In it, the royal details not only her time in the war-torn country but the reception she received upon her return.</p><p>"Since returning to the UK, many people have said how brave or courageous I was for going. I am neither," she wrote. "The brave people are those who have endured extreme violence and survived. The courageous are those who have reported the crimes committed against them."</p><p>Duchess Sophie went on to write that she is "glad to have made the journey," despite the horrible atrocities, pain, sadness and loss of life she was exposed to.</p><p>"Inevitably it was sad and emotional, and the painful stories and images, as with all my visits to places of conflict, will live with me," she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XZrrUorE6P8rpLASNdNEgA-1920-80.jpg><p>According to the Duchess' own account, very few people knew she was making the secret trip to Ukraine among the country's ongoing war against Russia.</p><p>"With very few people knowing of my visit, I travelled with only my private secretary, a Foreign Office adviser, and a security team," she wrote. "We reached Kyiv after a long day of travel through Warsaw, and, with no flights, took the well-travelled rail route to the capital that, amazingly, the Ukrainians have kept going during the war."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

"Historically, this has often been viewed as a casualty or symptom of war, rather than a deliberate tactic to overpower. It is only more recently that increased recognition has been given to these heinous crimes, and society has come to understand that it is used to demean, destroy and control, with the aftermath long felt through stigma, devastating physical and mental health repercussions and children born of rape. It is a weapon requiring no training, no investment, and it is deployed globally."</p><p>Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, there have been an estimated 169 cases of conflict-related sexual violence in the region, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGicpZi1pr%2FSZqqoqJiesm7ByquYoqaVYsOqv8itZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./farrah-aldjufrie-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Farrah Aldjufrie Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./davido-shows-support-for-rema-as-singer-suspends-december-shows-over-health-concerns.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Davido Shows Support for Rema As Singer Suspends December Shows Over Health Concerns</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
