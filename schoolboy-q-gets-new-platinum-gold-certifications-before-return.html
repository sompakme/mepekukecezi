However, he at least has a great foot to start off on if plans don't work out as expected, for which fans have been very patient for. Moreover, the TDE lyricist received nine new plaques from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with new gold and platinum certifications on Wednesday (January 3). Eight of these are for singles, whereas his 2019 project CrasH Talk went gold.

"This is our life, like me talking about our situations," he said on the BACKONFIGG podcast. "You know, the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">s**t we done been through</a>, homies we done lost to the system or to the streets. Like, me talkin’ about my mama's trauma from her own brothers. You can’t compare that to somebody that won an NBA championship.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"When it comes to music, I don’t look at it as like, ‘Oh, you have to drop every year,’" he went on. "I’m like, no, your favorite&nbsp;rapper&nbsp;has to drop every year because he needs chili. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I do what I want because I move off peace, I move off my experiences</a>. As a[n] artist, if I bring nothing to the table that comes from my life, I don’t feel I should put it out."

Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnan14gJdmqpygn6S5o7vYZqhmm5WnwaqyyJyYraGfo8BuvMuaq6KmpaJ6qLvLnWRraGJpeqm1z2afqKhdo7K4vw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./see-as-baba-dey-blush-peggy-ovire-throws-freddie-leonard-surprise-birthday-bash-video-goes-v.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>See As Baba Dey Blush: Peggy Ovire Throws Freddie Leonard Surprise Birthday Bash, Video Goes V</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./raquel-welch-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Raquel Welch Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
