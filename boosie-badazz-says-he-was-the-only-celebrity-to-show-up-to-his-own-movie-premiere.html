(Photo by Bennett Raglin/Getty Images for BET)</p><p>Boosie hit Twitter where he shared a photo of himself on the red carpet of his movie’s debut. He revealed that no celebrities, including his closest friends in the music industry, showed up to celebrate.</p><p>“The only celebrity who came to my movie premiere!! Me,” he wrote alongside a link to pre-order the movie.</p><p>Boosie publicly asked his peers in hip-hop to help him promote the film, especially since his Instagram page was taken down, just days before.</p><p>“If you fuck with Boosie, mane, and you an artist, mane, I need a post up, bruh,” he said. “You know y’all got all them followers. When y’all post a n***a, that really help a n***a’s shit get out there. You already know that. So, if you fuck with Boosie, give me a post up.”</p><p>Boosie also flexes his acting chops in WaterBoyz and serves as an executive producer.</p><p>Check out the trailer for the movie below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkaIJ3hJBmmaino56ybq7AnZizsl2orrq%2FjKGcZq%2BRqHq1tMRmpqekqWKwprjEm6mirKliwbB50qGmsGWlpXq1u4yhoKxln6y7brnOr6CeZaCnsq61xKuc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-a-2-year-old-ride-on-a-golf-cart.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Can a 2 year old ride on a golf cart?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alinity-divine-bio-family-career-boyfriend-history-measurements.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alinity Divine Bio, Family, Career, Boyfriend, History, Measurements</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
