While the 26-year-old is known for her billion-dollar cosmetics empire, she is also quite renowned for the handful of high-profile relationships she’s been in. Jenner gained public interest when she debuted on Keeping Up with the Kardashians in 2007, and since then, most of her life has been highly publicized. As a result, much of her love life has also been shared with the public since then. The media personality has had an interesting dating history, and at the moment, she is with one of Hollywood’s bankable stars. From <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her current beau, Timothée Chalamet</a>, all the way back to her controversial connection with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tyga</a>, let’s take a look at Jenner’s romances, old and new.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-cody-simpson-2011>Cody Simpson (2011)</h2></span><p>SAN JOSE, CA - FEBRUARY 25: Musician Cody Simpson performs during 'We Day California' at SAP Center on February 25, 2015 in San Jose, California. (Photo by C Flanigan/FilmMagic)</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kylie Jenner was supposedly in a brief relationship with singer Cody Simpson. While glimpses of their alleged relationship never made it to the media, Simpson did acknowledge its existence. They broke up after a brief run in 2011. In a 2014 interview on Hello Ross, the singer shared, “The whole K-O-D-Y thing didn’t really work for me.”</p><span></span><p>LOS ANGELES, CA - NOVEMBER 24: Actor Jaden Smith (L) and Television personality Kylie Jenner attend the 2013 American Music Awards at Nokia Theatre L.A. Live on November 24, 2013 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/AMA2013/FilmMagic)</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kylie Jenner and Jaden Smith remained friends after their alleged breakup. While Smith and Jenner never actually confirmed that they were a couple, many reports labeled them as one. The pair did spend a lot of time together, and it’s through Jaden that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Kylie met Jordyn Woods</a>. However, if they did date, they didn’t last past late 2013 because Jenner was soon affiliated with rapper Tyga.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-tyga-2014-2017>Tyga (2014 - 2017)</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 12: Tyga (L) and Kylie Jenner attend the Alexander Wang Spring 2016 fashion show during New York Fashion Week at Pier 94 on September 12, 2015 in New York City. (Photo by Craig Barritt/Getty Images)</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Tyga and Kylie Jenner’s relationship sparked controversy because Jenner was a minor when the two were first rumored to be dating in 2011. However, Tyga renounced every such rumor and supposedly stepped back from Jenner to curb the speculations. At least, he did until 2014, when he hosted Jenner’s 17th birthday. Subsequently, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Tyga called off his engagement with Blac Chyna</a>, with whom he shares a child. Although he denied ending things with Chyna because of Jenner, the rapper was soon seen spending much time with her and getting her lavish gifts. Despite being heavily criticized for their relationship, the pair remained together for three years in an on-and-off romance. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">They ended things for good in 2017</a>.</p><span></span><p>SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA - AUGUST 27: Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner attend the Premiere Of Netflix's "Travis Scott: Look Mom I Can Fly" at Barker Hangar on August 27, 2019 in Santa Monica, California.

The pair was first seen together in April 2017 and soon sparked dating rumors. A couple of months later, the rumors turned out to be true. Following multiple public appearances, their romance was pretty obvious to the press and on-lookers. By September, reports came in that a child from the couple was imminent. Evidently, their relationship had moved quite fast because they had been dating for less than a year at the time.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On February 1, Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott welcomed their first child, Stormi. Subsequently, following a break, the couple got back together, and on February 2, 2022, they welcomed their second child. The couple stayed cozy until October when rumors surfaced about Scott cheating on Jenner. Things changed afterward because, by January 2023, reports confirmed that the two had separated, and it <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">doesn’t look like they will be getting back together</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-timothee-chalamet-2023>Timothée Chalamet (2023)</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 10: Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet are seen at the Final game with Novak Djokovic vs. Daniil Medvedev at the 2023 US Open Tennis Championships on September 10, 2023 in New York City.

Afterward, on April 13, photos emerged of Jenner’s car at Chalamet’s home, piquing the interest of fans and the media. Amid media scrutiny and a not-so-subtle diss on a track off Travis Scott’s latest album, the new couple seem to be having a great time. Jenner and Chalamet made their first public appearance as a couple on September 4, when <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">they attended Beyoncé’s Renaissance concert</a>. At the event, they unabashedly displayed their mutual affection for each other, kissing and cuddling in public.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Demilade Phillips has been a Features Writer for HotNewHipHop since 2023.
