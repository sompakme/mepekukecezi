Soon after the commercial aired, Beyoncé released the first teaser video for Act II on her Instagram.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is far from the first time Beyoncé's has hinted at new music to build anticipation: she previously teased the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a37269978/beyonce-new-music-album-b7/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="arrival of Renaissance" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">arrival of Renaissance</a> in an interview for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a37039502/beyonce-evolution-interview-2021/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harper's Bazaar's" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Harper's Bazaar's</a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a37039502/beyonce-evolution-interview-2021/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" September 2021 cover story" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"> September 2021 cover story</a>.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Beyoncé's Top 10 Red Carpet Moments" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-velocity-bey-10-1662557733.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I feel a renaissance emerging, and I want to be part of nurturing that escape in any way possible,” she said at the time. “I’ve been in the studio for a year and a half. Sometimes it takes a year for me to personally search through thousands of sounds to find just the right kick or snare. One chorus can have up to 200 stacked harmonies. Still, there’s nothing like the amount of love, passion, and healing that I feel in the recording studio. After 31 years, it feels just as exciting as it did when I was nine years old. Yes, the music is coming!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead, we break down everything to know about the project.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What will the new album be called?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a 12 March post on the Instagram account for her company Parkwood Entertainment, Beyoncé announced that “Act II” is officially titled Cowboy Carter, and shared promotional limited-edition artwork along with the news.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">What will the focus of Cowboy be?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The album will pay homage to the singer's Texan roots — judging from the teaser clip Beyoncé shared on Instagram. The video shows her driving through a desert landscape as banjo strings play in the background, leading many fans to speculate that she'll be shifting gears to release an entire album of country music. The teaser ends with a giant billboard of Beyoncé and the words, "Texas! Hold 'Em" – which is the name of one of the singles.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">What songs are on the tracklist?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beyoncé dropped the track list on 27 March. In addition to already-released singles “Texas Hold ’Em” and “16 Carriages”, Cowboy Carter also promises tracks titled “Ameriican Requiem” and “My Rose.” The track list also confirmed the rumours of a Dolly Parton collaboration, with the country legend’s name and hit “Jolene” included on the list.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">What is the release date?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">An Instagram video confirmed that Cowboy Carter will officially drop on 29 March.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Are there any visuals?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes, Beyoncé has already several images: one, for “Texas Hold ’Em”, shows the singer wearing a metallic bra, chain garter and matching underwear, which she layers underneath a cropped leather jacket. Another, a black-and-white portrait for “16 Carriages”, is more wistful, featuring Beyoncé clad in a cowboy hat and a studded Western-style shirt.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We also have the cover for the album, which shows Beyoncé astride a white horse, in full rodeo gear, including a white cowboy hat and leather chaps.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">What inspired the album?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While unveiling the official album art for Cowboy Carter, Beyoncé opened up on Instagram about what inspired the project. Specifically, she seemed to be alluding to her 2016 performance with the Dixie Chicks at the 50th annual Country Music Association Awards ceremony, where, it was rumoured, other country artists were not pleased to see her grace the stage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I feel honored to be the first Black woman with the number one single on the Hot Country Songs chart. That would not have happened without the outpouring of support from each and every one of you. My hope is that years from now, the mention of an artist’s race, as it relates to releasing genres of music, will be irrelevant,” she wrote on Instagram. “This album has been over five years in the making. It was born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed… and it was very clear that I wasn’t. But, because of that experience, I did a deeper dive into the history of Country music and studied our rich musical archive. It feels good to see how music can unite so many people around the world, while also amplifying the voices of some of the people who have dedicated so much of their lives educating on our musical history.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The star also promised there were “a few surprises” on the new album, saying she had “collaborated with some brilliant artists” whom she deeply respects. As a whole, Beyoncé said, Cowboy Carter was a way to challenge herself creatively and also the world’s perception of her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The criticisms I faced when I first entered this genre forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me. act ii is a result of challenging myself, and taking my time to bend and blend genres together to create this body of work,” she wrote. “I hope that you can hear my heart and soul, and all the love and passion that I poured into every detail and every sound.”</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7wG1tcGpmaIF1e8GesKimk5p6s7HNmqCsq5GjsKZ5wJyrZqGZYrumw4ymrKyhk2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blanca-clemente-s-biography-what-is-known-about-%C3%A1lvaro-morte-s-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blanca Clementes biography: what is known about lvaro Mortes wife?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adamari-l%C3%B3pez-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adamari Lpez Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
