May D</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt31o2pd89c28g.jpg><p>Remember when songs by May D like Ile Ijo and Many Things rocked the airwaves in Nigeria? Remember the nostalgia right? These days it’s the fact that he was or is dating a Swedish woman named Carolina Wassmuth that people seem to be interested in. he released a song with Wizkid in July this year but no one paid attention. Maybe a video for the song may help his cause.</p><p><strong>2. Lord of Ajasa</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytt2vd0q17hqo.jpg><p>When I head Lord of Ajasa was to release a song with Olamide titled 36 Kinihun ft. Olamide back in 2014, I thought ‘Thank God at least we would hear something fresh from the pioneer Yoruba rapper’. Alas, the song dropped and it was just there.&nbsp; Not a good record for a man who once gave us hit songs like Le Fenu So ft. 9ice.</p><p><strong>3. Phenom</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7fuimj4i60t.jpg><p>The self-styled Knight House general was once admired for his impeccable flows and sublime word play. But it seems Topa Onimowo aka Phenom’s interest in music has fizzled away. I mean this guy was so good that the almighty Wizkid jumped on the remix of his song Murda Dem.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;Olamide, Iyanya: 6 overrated artistes in Nigeria</p><p><strong>4. MP aka Mastaplan</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt455h5huqvuq.jpg><p>The JJC and 419 Squad led by JJC Funke Akindele’s husband were quite popular in the early 2000’s. but when they broke up, it was &nbsp;Brent Gbadebo aka Mastaplan or MP that first achieved mainstream success amongst the lot.</p><p>With hit songs such as Pasa Pasa and No Dull Yourself blazing released in 2009 and 2007 respectively, MP was set for a bright career. But he disappeared suddenly only to resurface in Delaware, USA having being given an award as the outstanding healthcare professional of the Month for October 2015 by the community of ambulance service providers in the state. Guess music is over for him.</p><p><strong>5. 2Shotz</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt12upjjdd79s8.jpg><p>Umunamo! It was normal to hear William Orioha aka 2Shotz scream this on his songs being played on radio stations across the country. Songs like Carry am Go, Delicious ft. Big Lo and Make Dem Talk are still considered classics.&nbsp; However in recent times, his marital issues have taken the shine from his music.</p><p><strong>6. D’Prince</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4ldhs0jmq32.jpg><p>Believe it or not, Don Jazzy’s younger brother D’Prince has a slew of hit songs under his belt. Remember Take Banana, Omoba and the more recent O.Y.O come to mind when his name is mentioned. However in recent times, the likes of Reekado Banks, Di Ja and Korede Bello have taken the shine off him.</p><p><strong>7. Chuddy K</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytje1r774catk.jpg><p>It is weird to think that in 2012, Chuddy K won the award for Best Street Pop at the Headies with the song Gaga Crazy. Since then, his other songs have not fared better. Even though his other songs like Shampoo and Brazilian Hair were sleeper hits.</p><p><strong>8. Marvelous Benji</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt50a17h6l7id.jpg><p>Straight from the ghetto of Ajegunle where he is or was based, Marvelous Benji &nbsp;once dished out hits for himself and other artistes from the once popular Jahoha studios. His hit single Swo (Brand New Dance) spurred on local dance moves like Swo and Konto. He recently released a song with Solid Star titled Lockdown and judging from the reception the song got, a comeback may be hard for this veteran.</p><p><strong>9. W4</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4531787iqlc.jpg><p>A one-time protégé of Sound Sultan, Adewale Adepoju aka W4 gained recognition amongst music lovers for his song Solo but it was the monster hit Kontrol that brought him mainstream success. Since then, none of the songs he has put out has lived up to the hype that Kontrol generated.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>10 ways to know a terrible Nigerian song&nbsp;</p><p><strong>10. Ikechukwu</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5j9tu0bakpp.jpg><p>My name is IKECHUKWU! Remember the song that introduced rapper Ikechukwu to us? If you don’t, how about Wine Am Well? ft. Dbanj and Don Jazzy? Or Critical ft. Dbanj? If you still don’t, it is either you were too young at the time of their release or the fact that we haven’t seen much of Ikechukwu lately has made you forget. Well, Ikechukwu has re-invented himself as an actor and he had a role in the highly anticipated film The Wedding by Kemi Adetiba.</p><p><strong>11. Djinee</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2om0vtgrrgkg.jpg><p>A one-time OAP with Soundcity and the big brother of Chocolate City artistes M.I, Jesse Jagz and Ice Prince (they all slept in his house when they moved to Lagos), Djinee was/is also an amazing singer. His single Ego is considered by many to be one of Nigeria’s greatest R&B songs of all time. No one knows what he is up to these days though. I still like his other songs like I No Dey Shame and Overkilling.</p><p>So, which artistes do you feel should be on this list?
