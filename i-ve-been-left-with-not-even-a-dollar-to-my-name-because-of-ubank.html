I have Optus chasing me for payment, the gas and electricity people chasing me, my gym has cancelled my membership and I had to sneak into my gym. I feel like I’m living like a fugitive having to request payment extensions for everything,” she explained.</p><p>“My Netflix will be cut off, it’s just crazy. I’ve already been through the annoyance of having to update all of my direct debits as like everyone else I had to a get new card, BSB and account number and I just updated all payments and now they have all bounced.</p><p>“I the lead up to Christmas it’s just annoying.

I am a lot more calm now as I know there is nothing else I can do now I have stopped fighting it,” she said.</p><p>But she added had been left “with absolutely no access to any money” for days and it was just not good enough.</p><p>“I’m appalled at their lack of empathy and disorganisation,” she added.</p><p>A spokesperson for Ubank said: “We can’t talk about specific customers due to confidentiality requirements.

Where the risk needle rises, so too does the need for institutions to act. When this happens, you see debanking happening more often.”</p><p><i>*Name has been changed for privacy reasons</i></p><p>– with Alexis Carey</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Sydney data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Sydney</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2SvorrKoqWgZ5mrsm6uxJ6lZqSVm8Fuw8itn2amn6l6psLEp2SaZZSkua2t0WarqGWdrnqvrcyeZJudk5bCtLGMqJ1mpalir6K6ymilnq%2BjYsC1u9GyZmlsZGyuen2SbnBqaWJshqOywZyZnGlpaoGjrZVpnHGe</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jena-malone-catches-fire-as-johanna-mason-in-the-hunger-games-sequel.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jena Malone Catches Fire as Johanna Mason In The Hunger Games Sequel</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-it-better-to-cut-hair-with-scissors-or-clippers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is it better to cut hair with scissors or clippers?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
