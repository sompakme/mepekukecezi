Notary public certification is proof of your legal transaction expertise and can increase your chances of getting hired. However, knowing how to properly highlight this skill set on your resume can be challenging. Here’s how to put notary on a resume to make the most of it.</p><h3><span id=What_is_a_Notary_Public_and_Why_Should_You_Add_it_to_Your_Resume>What is a Notary Public, and Why Should You Add it to Your Resume?</span></h3><p>A notary public is a person appointed by the state government to witness the signing of documents and administer oaths. They certify that the signatures on legal documents are authentic, the signatories are who they claim to be, and the document has not been tampered with.</p><p>As a notary, you have gained specialized skills that employers find valuable. You are detail-oriented, comfortable with legal documents, and have good communication skills. All these skills are sought after by many employers and can give you an edge over other candidates. Adding notary to your resume can be an excellent way to showcase these unique skills to your prospective employers.</p><h3><span id=Where_Should_You_List_Your_Notary_Status_on_Your_Resume>Where Should You List Your Notary Status on Your Resume?</span></h3><p>Your notary status should be listed under a separate “certification” section on your resume. This section should be placed right before or after your education section and can be structured like this:</p><p><strong>Certification:</strong><br>Notary Public, State of [Your State], [Year Obtained] Commission Expires: [Date]</p><p>This format is preferred as it’s easily scannable and highlights your notary status. You may also mention your notary status in your professional summary, work experience, or skills section wherever it seems most relevant.</p><h3><span id=What_Information_Should_You_Include_to_Show_Your_Notary_Status>What Information Should You Include to Show Your Notary Status?</span></h3><p>When you’re adding your notary status to your resume, you don’t need to include all of the details about your certification. The following information should suffice:</p><p>– Name of the state issuing your notary certification<br>– Date you received your notary certification<br>– Date your notary commission expires</p><p>These three pieces of information should convey everything a potential employer needs to know about your notary status without taking up too much space in your resume.</p><h3><span id=What8217s_the_Best_Way_to_Phrase_Your_Notary_Status_on_Your_Resume>What’s the Best Way to Phrase Your Notary Status on Your Resume?</span></h3><p>The phrasing of your notary status should be concise and impressive. Below are some examples of how to mention your notary status on your resume:</p><p>– Notary Public, State of California, Commission Expires 2024<br>– Commissioned Louisiana Notary Public, Expires June 2025<br>– State of New York Notary Public, Commission Expires November 2022</p><p>These phrases quickly inform potential employers of your notary status and the state that issued your certification while using active phrasing that emphasizes your competence and achievements.</p><h3><span id=Can_You_Add_a_Notary_Public_Skill_Set_to_Your_Resume_Even_if_the_Notary_Certification_Has_Expired>Can You Add a Notary Public Skill Set to Your Resume Even if the Notary Certification Has Expired?</span></h3><p>No, it’s typically not a good idea to list your expired notary status on your resume. This could mislead employers into thinking you’re still performing notary services, which is illegal. Instead, remove the notation of your expired commission dates from your resume once your commission has lapsed. However, if you are still proficient in the legal document process, you may consider highlighting your competency in that area by detailing your related work experience.</p><h3><span id=How_Does_Being_a_Notary_Public_Enhance_Your_Resume>How Does Being a Notary Public Enhance Your Resume?</span></h3><p>Being a notary public enhances your resume because it shows that you have essential professional skills and expertise in legal transaction documents. The following points highlight the benefits of adding notary to your resume:</p><p>– Demonstrates your attention to detail: Notaries have to be meticulous and diligent in their work, so adding notary to your resume shows that you have the attention to detail employers are seeking.<br>– Highlights your communication skills: As a notary, you have to be able to explain legal documents and safeguards clearly to clients, which means you’re good at communicating complex ideas.<br>– Demonstrates your legal document expertise: As a notary public, you are well-versed with legal documents, requirements, processes, and regulations. This expertise is an asset to your employers.<br>– Shows that you take your profession seriously: Notaries have to obtain and maintain their certification, demonstrating their commitment to their professional standards.<br>– Gives you an edge over other candidates: Adding notary to your resume can make you stand out among other job candidates, demonstrating your unique skillset and making it more likely that employers will choose you for the job.</p><h3><span id=What_if_You_Are_Not_a_Notary_Public_Yet>What if You Are Not a Notary Public Yet?</span></h3><p>If you’re not a notary public yet but want to become one, there are a few requirements to meet. You must:</p><p>– Be at least 18 years old<br>– Be a legal resident of your state<br>– Have a clean criminal record<br>– Complete a notary training course<br>– Pass a state notary exam<br>– Submit an application to your state’s notary public governing office</p><p>Once you’ve completed these steps and obtained your notary certification, you can add it to your resume.</p><h3><span id=What_If_You_Work_in_a_Field_That_Does_Not_Require_a_Notary_Status>What If You Work in a Field That Does Not Require a Notary Status?</span></h3><p>Even if you work in a field that doesn’t require a notary status, the skill set you acquire as a notary public is still valuable. You can highlight these skills on your resume by adding them to your “skills” section. For example:</p><p>– Detail-oriented with strong attention to accuracy and completeness<br>– Comfortable with legal documents and processes<br>– Capable of analyzing and interpreting laws and regulations<br>– Possess excellent communication and customer service skills<br>– Demonstrates problem solving and conflict resolution skills</p><p>While you may not need to use your notary skills in your day-to-day role, adding these attributes to your resume showcases your valuable experience and highlights your work capabilities.</p><h3><span id=Is_it_Essential_to_Include_the_Notary_Public_Certification_on_Every_Resume>Is it Essential to Include the Notary Public Certification on Every Resume?</span></h3><p>Including your notary certification is only essential if you perform notary services as part of your daily job or if the employer considers notary status to be an essential requirement for the job. If neither of these applies, you may consider adding your certification if you feel it may set you apart from other candidates and add value to your application.</p><h3><span id=What_Else_Can_You_Do_to_Highlight_Your_Notary_Status>What Else Can You Do to Highlight Your Notary Status?</span></h3><p>In addition to showing your notary status on your resume, there are many other ways you can utilize your notary certification to enhance your job search:</p><p>– List your notary status on your LinkedIn profile to showcase your expertise to potential employers.<br>– Update your signature to reflect your notary status, both on paper and digitally.<br>– Include your notary status on business cards and networking materials.<br>– Consider applying for jobs specifically requiring a notary public certificate such as banking, legal, or real estate industries.<br>– Join professional organizations of notaries to expand your knowledge and network.</p><p>Utilizing your notary status outside of your resume shows that you take pride in your certification and are committed to maintaining the high standards expected of a notary public.</p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>In summary, adding notary to your resume can set you apart from other job candidates and showcase the unique skillset acquired through your certification. To add notary to your resume, create a certification section and include the state that issued your certification, the date you received certification, and the date your notary commission expires. Highlighting your notary status also demonstrates your attention to detail, legal document expertise, communication skills, shows that you take your profession seriously and gives you an edge over other applicants. By properly highlighting your notary status on your resume and utilizing it outside of your job search, you can showcase your valuable experience and position yourself for new career opportunities.</p><span class=kksr-muted>Please help us rate this post</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKm71marqGWgqsFuus6tmKuxXaS7bq2Mq5ysrZ2afA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jacquees-queen-naija-drop-silky-r-b-single-bed-friend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jacquees &amp;amp; Queen Naija Drop Silky R&amp;amp;B Single &amp;quot;Bed Friend&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-many-hours-from-abu-dhabi-to-chicago.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Many Hours From Abu Dhabi To Chicago</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
