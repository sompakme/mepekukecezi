Whether Gil’s dating life is more casual or serious isn’t yet known.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/gil-cuero-IG-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gil Cuero shares which reality show he would try out for&nbsp;</h2><p>While Gil’s marriage to Myrla ultimately was unsuccessful, his time on the show still garnered a large fan base, with many feeling Gil had a great presence on camera. Some fans even wanted Gil to take over as host of the Married at First Sight after show to continue to see him on screen.&nbsp;</p><p>Hosting a Married at First Sight aftershow may not currently be in the cards for Gil, with Keshia Knight Pulliam now taking the reigns as Afterparty host, but Gil could return to reality television.&nbsp;</p><p>During Gil’s Q&A, a fan asked, “Will you ever try out for any other Reality Shows?”</p><p>Gil replied with a poster for The Amazing Race. The Amazing Race debuted in 2001 and recently returned earlier this year. It seems Gil could be interested in appearing in a future season.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/gil-cuero-IG-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gil Cuero feels healed after heartbreaking divorce&nbsp;</h2><p>Myrla’s request for a divorce was very hard on Gil, as was visible during the Married at First Sight Season 13 reunion.&nbsp;</p><p>After his marriage came to a sad end, Gil got into therapy to help heal.&nbsp;</p><p>A fan asked about his healing journey, asking, “How is your healing coming along? Are you still in therapy?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/gil-cuero-IG-3.jpg><p>Gil replied, “Still in therapy. I’m going once a month now since it’s been a year now. I believe I’m healed. My continuance with therapy now has to do with self growth and learning new ways to control my thoughts for when life throws a curve ball.”&nbsp;</p><p>Married at First Sight airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on Lifetime.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5eeuW6v1J6pqGWimsOmrcusZKGdo2KxosDIp55mmZeWtq95wKebZquYlr%2Bmv4ywn6KbmGK%2Fpq3LoquyZaOdvLh5x56bZqyirnqvsdetZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./harper-beckham-s-surprising-personality-trait-revealed-in-new-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Harper Beckham's surprising personality trait revealed in new video</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./geri-horner-opts-for-a-figure-hugging-white-dress-to-celebrate-f1-win-with-her-husband-christian-hor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Geri Horner opts for a figure hugging white dress to celebrate F1 win with her husband Christian Hor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
