Moreover, this resulted in the bombshell claim that Bilaal saw Will and Duane Martin <a href=# rel>having intercourse</a>, which Jada Pinkett Smith and her husband might sue for regarding defamatory claims. However, there's another scandalous and unfounded thing he spoke on that has actually been part of the gossip train for a while. This relates to Marc Anthony, who was with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Jennifer Lopez</a> at the time, cheating on her with Jada, who remains with the actor to this day.</p><p>Furthermore, this is another installment in a long-running series around conversations around the Smiths' <a href=# rel>alleged or proven infidelity</a>. Back to the story, though: Brother Bill claims that Jada Pinkett Smith and Marc Anthony had a romantic relationship on the set of the show Hawthorne. While Will was apparently fine with this according to Brother Bilaal, even as gossip outlets reported on it, the "final straw" was when he allegedly caught his wife and the singer having intercourse on their couch. This, Brother Bilaal says, "devastated" Will and led him into suicidal thoughts, whereas he also claimed that this prompted Anthony's divorce from Jennifer Lopez.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel>Diddy Addresses Will Smith Fight Rumor Over Jennifer Lopez & Jada Pinkett Smith Threesome</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-brother-bilaal-with-more-allegations-about-jada-pinkett-will-smith-watch>Brother Bilaal With More Allegations About Jada Pinkett & Will Smith: Watch</h2></span><p>Of course, this is all baseless, speculative, and inflammatory gossip from one man, so take this with a huge grain of salt. If anything, it's ironic how this interview and other allegations actually put Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith in the same camp. Before, during the actress' promo run for her memoir Worthy, she solely spoke from her perspective on how rocky their relationship was. Now, though, it seems like they're both <a href=# rel>committed to defending each other</a> and fighting against what they call lies and blatant attacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, all this drama is taking place as the Fresh Prince remains <a href=# rel>pretty tight-lipped</a>, other than at least two instances addressing it. One was a video of him sleeping through a bumpy boat ride, indicating that he's unfazed by the chaos. Another was an email to The New York Times that supported the Baltimore native on her journey and opened up to her emotional nuances. We'll see if or when he decides to make a more complete return to the public eye. Until then, log back into HNHH for the latest news and updates on Will and Jada Pinkett Smith.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel>Jada Pinkett Smith Threatens Legal Action Over Will Smith & Duane Martin Sex Rumor</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnaIN0gJFmrqKknGLArrXToWSjmZSWerG1zaScraxdqLqqwMdmpJqqk2Kur8DHqKWyZZievW60zqlkp52nqA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mary-joan-schutz-learn-more-about-gene-wilder-s-spouse.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Mary Joan Schutz: learn more about Gene Wilder's spouse</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
