McNamara had spent years of her life hunting the killer and had said her greatest wish was to see him behind bars.

Bolonik quotes Oswalt as saying:</p><p>"'It wasn’t even in my head. And all that synchronicity...no, I’m not going to say there was, because Michelle'—who had a comically fierce distaste for the notion of serendipity and coincidence—'would just laugh at that.'"</p><p>The immediate reason DeAngelo was arrested: DNA belonging to a relative of DeAngelo matched DNA found at one of the crime scenes. The relative had submitted their DNA to a genealogy website to learn more about their family history (<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/04/27/data-on-a-genealogy-site-led-police-to-the-golden-state-killer-suspect-now-others-worry-about-a-treasure-trove-of-data/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>police use of DNA databases has proven controversial</a>). Detectives traced the relative's family tree to DeAngelo, who fit the profile of the Golden State Killer they'd been hunting for decades. The profile of DeAngelo was also similar to the one McNamara had developed: DeAngelo was revealed to be a Navy veteran and former cop who'd been fired in 1979, andMcNamara had speculated that he was affiliated with the military and/or police.</p><p>But Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones did not credit McNamara's work with directly cracking the case,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/golden-state-killer-michelle-mcnamara-patton-oswalt-joseph-james-deangelo-arrest-california-a8322961.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>saying</a>, "It kept interest and tips coming in but other than that there was no information extracted from that book that directly led to the apprehension."</p><p>Oswalt responded at the time: “They haven’t been very clear...For all we know, what if one of his family members read Michelle’s book and ratted him out? Or someone in his community? She spent years keeping this case alive and out there, so the whole story hasn’t been told yet.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>You did it, baby.

The late writer spent years bringing awareness to the case, interviewing victims, researching and visiting crime scenes, working with investigators, and bringing together disparate pieces of research and investigation from different cities and precincts. She even coined the nickname The Golden State Killer. At the time of the arrest, Oswalt commented, “It’s so ironic to see a press conference where they say the book gave us no help but they’re using the term ‘Golden State Killer,’ which she coined, and which gave them the umbrella to put these cases together.”<br></p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

She just wasn’t riding shotgun with me.” He gave context to the official statement: “Law enforcement is funny, because even though, particularly in this case, where the model of an interagency cooperative, there’s still territorial boundaries."</p><p>Holes added, "Michelle had the freedom to call anyone she wanted, whether it be victims or witnesses or original investigators across various jurisdictions, so she talked to people that I hadn’t and [found] out details that weren’t written in the case files and she would pass those on to me.”</p><p>At the time, Oswalt also&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/golden-state-killer-michelle-mcnamara-patton-oswalt-joseph-james-deangelo-arrest-california-a8322961.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>explained</a>&nbsp;that McNamara didn't care about having a bestseller or receiving praise for the capture of the accused killer. "She cared about the Golden State Killer being behind bars and the victims getting some relief."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGxqaWuEeoKPaJuinF2itqS0xKWjnmWdmLuiucCrmGaemaOxbsDHnmSgp5yZsq950q2YrZ1doLatuMSrZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./does-ash-ever-meet-his-dad.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Ash ever meet his dad?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./charlotte-caffey-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Charlotte Caffey Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
