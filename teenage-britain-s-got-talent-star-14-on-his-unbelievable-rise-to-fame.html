I just thank God every day,” Magdalene, 51, tells <strong></strong> in this exclusive interview. Magdalene, an anaesthetist nurse who lives with Malakai and Faith, 18,in Kennington, south London, adds: “His success has been unbelievable. Everyone teases me at work - they call me celebrity mum and always tell me they voted for him in the show.”</p><p id=edF71sdRYw9 data-wc=15><a class=hm-link href=#>Exclusive photo album: Olly Murs and wife Amelia's 380-acre island wedding with 'mini Glastonbury' after-party</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cf20a14b021b-teenage-britains-got-talent-star-with-family.jpg><p id=emfjhe9157 data-wc=111>Malakai’s rise to fame came about after he auditioned for earlier this year. During his performance of Pie Jesu from Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Requiem, he deeply impressed the judges, leading to <a class=hm-link href=#>Simon Cowell</a> declaring he had: “One of the best voice I think I’ve ever heard,” before pressing the show’s famous Golden Buzzer which gave Malakai automatic entry into the final. Simon also said of his audition. Even the young man himself was shocked at the reaction. The whole experience of the show, he says, was: “Really cool to do. I'll never forget it. I've taken most of it in, but it's still unbelievable to me at times.”</p><p id=eipFe496tEq data-wc=12><strong>CONGRATS:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Janette Manrara and Aljaz Skorjanec welcome first baby!

He worked with Andrew Lloyd Webber on one of the tracks, telling <strong></strong>how he loved the experience. “He was really nice and had a lot of wisdom about everything – he told me how there's only two types of music: good music and bad music.” And he had an equally positive experience working with Bradley Cooper on the soundtrack for forthcoming Netflix soundtrack Maestro. “He was really fun and easy to work with. He would listen to my singing and sometimes tell me how to make it better. And then when I did it right he would give me a fist bump.”</p><p id=ekrW4yboHpe data-wc=41></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
