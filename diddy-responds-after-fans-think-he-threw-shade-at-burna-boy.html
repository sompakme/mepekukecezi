The Bad Boy founder shared appeared to throw shade at an unnamed artist following the Grammys, who he claimed he helped with their first Grammy. “I helped you win your first and only Grammy award which I did out of kindness, and somehow you thought you could win another without my help ?? Oh okay..,” he wrote.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The reason people believed this was directed at Burna Boy was due to the Nigerian singer’s nomination in the Best Global Album category at the Grammys. His latest album, Love, Damini, secured the nod, though it lost to Masa Takumi’s Sakura. Burna’s already earned six nominations in the past few years while only winning once for <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Twice As Tall</a>, executive produced by Diddy. The 2020 album won the Grammy for Best Global Music Album. Needless to say, fans put the pieces together and suggested that Diddy felt some way about the “Last Last” artist.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As the internet shared their thoughts, Diddy finally responded to the backlash. Though the screenshot of his Instagram post circulated online, he suggested that it may have been a photoshop job. “This is fake,” he wrote in the comment section. Still, many called him out as they claimed they saw it on his own Instagram Story.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Throughout his career, Diddy earned 13 nominations at the Grammys while winning three awards. Diddy won his first pair of Grammys in 1998. “I’ll Be Missing You” alongside <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Faith Evans</a> and 112 won Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group. That same evening, Diddy took home the Best Rap Album award for Puff Daddy and The Family’s No Way Out.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Perhaps, Diddy’s striving towards winning a fourth Grammy next year. Last year, Puffy announced his R&B-focused label, Love Records, through which he’ll release his forthcoming album. He previously released “Gotta Move On” ft. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Bryson Tiller</a> to launch the campaign for the project. Then, he teamed up with OVO’s <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>PartyNextDoor</a> for “<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Sex In The Porsche</a>.” Though he hasn’t shared a release date for the project yet, it’s possible the project sees a summer release date. We’ll keep you posted on anymore updates surrounding the upcoming R&B album.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
