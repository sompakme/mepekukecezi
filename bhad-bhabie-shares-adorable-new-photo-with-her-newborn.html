Once the world saw the 20-year-old's growing bump, there was little room to speculate, and fans couldn't be more excited for the mother-to-be. Now, the internet icon is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">officially in mommy mode</a>, dropping off an adorable new photo of her and her bundle of joy.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the sweet selfie, Bhad Bhabie and her little one are seen snuggled up in bed, rocking cozy coordinating fits. For privacy reasons, she opted to shield her baby's face with a pink heart emoji, which she later addressed in an Instagram Story. She reposted a previous Story from none other than <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a>, who also recently welcomed a daughter. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"If I show my daughter face it will break da net she so fyre,"</a> the "SkeeYee" performer wrote.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bhad-bhabie-amp-kali-love>Bhad Bhabie & Kali Love</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While Bhad Bhabie has kept mostly quiet online since her daughter's arrival, she appears to be adjusting well to motherhood, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">despite any previous concerns</a> from critics. During a chat with PEOPLE in February, she responded to those doubting her parenting skills, revealing that she wishes she wasn't judged by how she acted as a teenager.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“How can you, from your computer screen, determine if I’m ready to be a mother or not?” she wondered.&nbsp;"<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I wish more people knew my story</a>&nbsp;and really understood the things that made me who I am. And that they wouldn’t just look at a certain time of my life and expect me to be that person forever, especially when I was so young." What do you think of Bhad Bhabie finally becoming a mother?
