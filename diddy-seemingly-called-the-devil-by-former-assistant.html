Ms. Capricorn Clark made the claim in a post to her private Twitter account. "Black women end up being the sacrifice for the f-ckery. Last 11 years of my life, I have had to deal with EVERYONES nonsensical allegiance to the devil. I pray that ends. I don't think highly of any of you. Can't keep your head down + pretend sh-t is cool no more. Do better," Clark wrote.</p><p>The statement comes days after Diddy was hit with a third lawsuit of sexual assault. In the suit, the anonymous woman claims she went on a date with Diddy in 1991 while attending Syracuse. However, she alleges that Diddy drugged her during dinner, before <a href=# rel>filming them while he raped her</a>. Furthermore, she claims that she was later made aware that the video of the assault had been shown to and viewed by multiple people. The wave of allegations against Diddy has come after his former long-time partner <a href=# rel>Cassie</a> released a series of horrific allegations against him in her own suit.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Diddy's Ex-Bodyguard Reacts To Cassie Name-Dropping Him In Lawsuit</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-former-diddy-protege-says-there-more-victims-are-out-there>Former Diddy Protégé Says There More Victims Are Out There</h2></span><p>Furthermore, Diddy's former <a href=# rel>protégé</a>, Aubrey O'Day, has made shocking claims of her own. "I got fired 4 being ‘promiscuous’ on national TV. Not only false, but y’all know now that man loves promiscuity. So why did I really get fired? Y’all already know. And as talented as I was, the only job opportunity I was offered after was the cover of Playboy. ALL part of grooming," O'Day said on X, formerly Twitter. At the time of writing, three women have come forward with allegations about Diddy. Some of these allegations date back to the 1990s.</p><p>Furthermore, O'Day hinted at there being more victims who weren't able to come forward. "Not everyone that was assaulted, abused, or harassed was able to make that deadline safely with proper protections in place. Or has even begun to come forward. Straight up, if you think this shit being silenced for years only happened once or twice, you are sadly mistaken," O'Day said in a separate post.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>50 Cent Trolls Diddy With Hilarious Pants-less Photo</a></strong></p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnaIV3g5hmm6KclK56tbTEZpuerpmheqKvwq6qmqyZpLu0</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./edward-norton-height-wife-shauna-robertson-net-worth-age-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Edward Norton Height, Wife (Shauna Robertson), Net Worth, Age, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dababy-follows-in-moneybagg-yo-s-footsteps-with-new-look.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>DaBaby Follows In Moneybagg Yo's Footsteps With New Look</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
