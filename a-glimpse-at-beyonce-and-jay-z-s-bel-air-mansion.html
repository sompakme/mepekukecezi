The singer recently won her 32nd Grammy at the 2023 awards – more than anyone in history. It would seem that the only person who rivals the Renaissance artist is her husband, Jay-Z – the rapper who has acquired 24 Grammy awards in his career. Together, the power couple has a record-breaking 176 nominations between them. So, it is only fair that their residence is equally unsurpassed.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple's L.A. 'mega-mansion' set the standard for some of the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/house-design/worlds-best-homes>world's best homes</a> – complete with a media room, a host of wellness facilities, and four outdoor swimming <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/ideas/pool-ideas>pools</a>, to name only a few of its assets.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-jayz-beyonce-bel-air-mansion-20170817-story.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Los Angeles Times</a> reported that Beyoncé and Jay-Z's $90-million transaction was set to be the highest this year in the County in 2017 when the couple purchased the home.&nbsp;</p><p>The impressive estate, which was never publicly offered for sale, originally carried a reported asking price of $135 million, but the $90-million deal still made headlines – tieing with the 2016 sale of storied Owlwood for the third-most expensive home historically in the Los Angeles area.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps understandably, Beyoncé keeps many of her home's <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/ideas/decorating-ideas>decorating ideas</a> private – however, there are some exceptions. The singer sometimes shares her home's interiors via Instagram, and rare interviews similarly paint a picture of the residence.&nbsp;</p><p>These glimpses suggest Beyoncé and Jay Z favor a sleek neutral color palette – from the stylish living room (that offers a masterclass in <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/advice/decorating-with-grey>decorating with gray</a>) to the cream and white dining room and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/ideas/walk-in-closet-ideas>walk-in closet</a> (seen from the second image on the photo carousel above).&nbsp;</p><p>'I find myself truly en famille, sitting at Beyoncé’s dinner table on a Sunday night. I’m a little stunned at how relaxed it all is,' says <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/beyonce-vogue-cover-new-music referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>British Vogue's</a> editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, who visited the estate in 2022. 'Sure, the house is impressively minimalist, with acres of white walls, gleaming glass, and beautiful art. As a scrumptious dinner of ribs, cream corn, peas, and mashed potatoes are served, I’m not sure the mood could be any cozier.'</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Design expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups.</p><p>Beyond the neutral <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/room-color-ideas>color ideas</a>, the modern estate exhibits large glass window panes that drench many rooms in sunlight (as seen below). The home overlooks the prestigious Bel Air area and overlooks West Los Angeles. The architectural jewel of a house was completed in 2017 – and comprises six separate structures with around 30,000 square feet of interior space.&nbsp;</p><p>According to The Los Angeles Times, the exteriors are equally as impressive. The estate boasts sprawling patios and terraces that bring an additional 10,000 square feet of living space beyond the four walls.&nbsp;</p><p>The two-acre compound also has a full basketball court and staff quarters – as well as a garage space for up to 15 vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvMnqqappScrrOwxKeqZ5ufonyvsdasZpudqaS7pLGMo5iyZapir6a4jJqgq2Wdlru0tc6n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andy-grammer-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andy Grammer Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-ali-riley-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-rumours-and-facts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ali Riley Dating Now? -Past Relationships, Current Relationship Status, Rumours, and Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
