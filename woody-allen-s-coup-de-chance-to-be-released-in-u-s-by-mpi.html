Today, THR can exclusively report that those who wish to see the 88-year-old’s latest project, which debuted at the Venice Film Festival in early September to (mostly) positive reviews, can do so without slinking around or needing secret codes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">MPI Media Group will release the picture, Allen’s 50th theatrically released feature film as a director, for North American markets on April 5, 2024. A digital/VOD release will follow on April 12.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The movie, shot in France in French, stars Lou de Laâge (Respire, The Mad Woman’s Ball) as a self-aware trophy wife who reconnects with an old chum from the Lycée Français in New York, played by Niels Schneider (Heartbeats, Sybil). Melvil Poupaud (A Christmas Tale, In Bed with Victoria) is the businessman-cuckold who has a less-than-typically-French response to the concept of extra-marital affairs. The movie then follows plot mechanics similar to Allen’s Crimes and Misdemeanors, Match Point, Cassandra’s Dream and Irrational Man.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Coup de Chance means “stroke of luck” in English. The film has already been released in many European markets, to the tune of $7.3 million.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The film was shot by Vittorio Storaro (Apocalypse Now, Reds, The Last Emperor) making it the fifth collaboration between Allen and the 83-year-old Italian cinematographer.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">MPI released Allen’s previous two films, Rifkin’s Festival in 2022 and A Rainy Day in New York in 2020. The earlier picture was initially financed as part of Allen’s 2016 deal with Amazon that resulted in a series of lawsuits after Amazon ended the relationship in 2017. (Amazon released the film Wonder Wheel and the streaming series Crisis in Six Scenes previously.)&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Amazon canceled the deal amid the #MeToo movement of 2017, when public opinion surrounding Allen soured considerably due to a reappraisal of accusations of sexual assault made against him by his adopted stepdaughter, Dylan Farrow. Though the Connecticut state’s attorney did not charge Allen after a 1993 investigation, Allen remains a polarizing figure.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The filmmaker and Amazon reached an out-of-court <a href=#>settlement</a> in November 2019.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Oddly enough, A Rainy Day in New York, which starred Timothée Chalamet and Selena Gomez, ended up being a surprise hit (<a href=# rel=nofollow>$28.3 million</a>) at the international box office, particularly <a href=#>in Asia</a>. Due to the weirdness of the COVID pandemic, Rainy Day was even the <a href=# rel=nofollow>No. 1 movie</a> at the worldwide box office for a little while, which is, one could say, atypical for Woody Allen. Also, for a stretch, the only legal way to see the movie in America was if you were <a href=# rel=nofollow>flying above it</a>, watching in-flight entertainment. The film is now streaming with ads on Peacock, Tubi and Crackle — and can be rented for a small fee on several platforms including, oddly enough, Amazon.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Chicago-based MPI Media Group dates back to 1976, and boasts all sorts of treasures in its home video catalog, like the complete Dark Shadows series packaged in a <a href=# rel=nofollow>coffin</a>. It also owns Dark Sky Films, which boasts recent horror hits like The House of the Devil, Stake Land, Deathgasm and Catfight. Try to imagine Woody Allen watching a movie called Deathgasm.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Coup de Chance was co-produced by Letty and Erika Aronson, Allen’s sister and niece.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLi7zp2wZpmcobKvecKorKlllJp6pLTAp5qeZZ2ltm65xJ2gmmWXp7y2vIxqaWxtaGd%2Fd4SWaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alexandra-isles-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alexandra Isles Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-miranda-lambert.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To Miranda Lambert?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
