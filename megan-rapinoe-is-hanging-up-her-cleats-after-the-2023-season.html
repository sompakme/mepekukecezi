Megan Rapinoe, one of the most prominent American soccer players of all time, announced that she'd be stepping away from the Beautiful Game after this year. She broke the news before yesterday's U.S. Women's National Soccer Team match against Wales (the U.S. won 2-0 in the friendly). The OL Reign closes out its 2023 season with a game against the Washington Spirit on Oct. 6.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rapinoe is 38 and currently plays for the OL Reign in the NWSL as of July 10, 2023, she has made 199 appearances for the United States senior team and has scored 63 goals.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This is going to be my last season, my last World Cup, and my last NWSL season,” she said at a press conference before yesterday's friendly. “Obviously, there will be more to come further down the road after hopefully we get done what we want to get done.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I could have just never imagined where this beautiful game would’ve taken me," she added. "I feel so honored to be able to have represented this country and this federation for so many years. It’s truly been the greatest thing that I’ve ever done.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also emphasized that she would be able to leave the game on her own terms — something she explained is “incredibly rare for athletes of any stature.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rapinoe earned two Women's World Cup titles and represented the USA at the Olympic Games three times, winning one gold medal in 2012 and a bronze medal in 2020 (though the games took place in 2021).&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rapinoe shared an official statement regarding her retirement from international competition with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>U.S. Soccer</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve been able to have such an incredible career, and this game has brought me all over the world and allowed me to meet so many amazing people,” she said in the statement. “I feel incredibly grateful to have played as long as I have, to be as successful as we’ve been, and to have been a part of a generation of players who undoubtedly left the game better than they found it. To be able to play one last World Cup and one last NWSL season and go out on my own terms is incredibly special."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I want to thank my family for being by my side all these years. Thanks to all my teammates and coaches all the way back to my first days in Redding, on to college at the University of Portland and, of course, thanks to U.S. Soccer, the Seattle Reign and especially Sue, for everything," the statement finished. "I will forever cherish the friendships and support over the years in this game, and I am beyond excited for one last ride with the National Team and the Reign."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6emqZdp66xtc2onGaqlam2s7HMnqWtZZGbwaa%2BjGtna2tdrLyusc2sZLCnoqGxbq%2FUqWSnr6OherSxwKymp2VnaoJ5gZVq</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-ditka-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mike Ditka Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-is-it-for-texas-id.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Is It For Texas Id</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
