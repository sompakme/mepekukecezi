MISC / K. Hari Kishnan photo</p><p>A highly invasive bird known to cause major damage to farms and spread invasive plants has been spotted on Maui, sparking concerns among agriculture and wildlife officials.</p><p>Native to Pakistan and India, red-vented bulbuls have long been established on Oahu but have remained absent on all other Hawaiian islands, according to the Maui Invasive Species Committee. Over the years, several individuals have been observed on Maui, however, they were removed, and no established breeding populations are known to exist on island.</p><p>On Nov. 28, Chris Warren, Forest Bird Program coordinator at Haleakala National Park, observed a male red-vented bulbul on Stable Road in Spreckelsville. Since then, several other sightings have been reported near Costco, Whole Foods and Queen Ka’ahumanu Center, though it is unknown if there are multiple birds or just one individual traveling throughout the area, MISC said in a news release Wednesday.</p><p>Two reports were also submitted Dec. 2 of sightings near Honolua and Kapalua Golf Course in West Maui, but these sightings have not yet been verified as red-vented bulbuls.</p><img width=589 height=759 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2021/12/09055618/os-red-vented-bulbul-juvenile.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Red-vented bulbuls are about 8 1/2 inches long and look like black cardinals. Adults are dark with a pointed crest on their head, a white abdomen and rump and crimson under the tail, as well as a slight white marking at the tip of their tail. The immature bulbul is like the adult but with some brownish edging on its feathers. MISC photos</p><p><span class=quotations>“Red-vented bulbuls are known to frequent port areas on Oahu and, the individual spotted could have hitchhiked on interisland shipping transports,”</span> explained Serena Fukushima, MISC public relations and education specialist. <span class=quotations>“It could have also been intentionally introduced, or blown over during strong wind events. At this time, officials are hoping there is only one individual bird on Maui, however, they need the public’s help in reporting any sightings to verify what and how many birds may potentially be on our island.”</span></p><p>The bird is about 8 1/2 inches long and looks like a black cardinal, according to MISC. Adults are dark with a pointed crest on their head, a white abdomen and rump and crimson under the tail, as well as a slight white marking at the tip of their tail. They make frequent loud calls. The immature bulbul is like the adult but with some brownish edging on its feathers. Bulbuls are often seen scavenging in parks, hunting for insects in the evening hours and sitting on telephone wires, and are one of the few birds that tend to land on the sides of trees.</p><p>Red-vented bulbuls are a serious agricultural and wildland pest in Hawaii and have caused significant damage on Oahu. They plague fruit farmers and nurseries, flocking in large groups and devouring commercial fruits such as papaya, mango, lychee and bananas. They also have a taste for orchid buds and reportedly caused more than $300,000 in damage to the Oahu orchid industry one year, according to MISC.</p><p>Bulbuls are also particularly good at dispersing high-priority plant pests targeted by invasive species committees such as ivy gourd and miconia. If red-vented bulbuls become established on Maui, they pose a severe threat to native forest ecosystems and Maui’s watersheds.</p><p>The birds are among the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Top 100 Invasive Species worldwide and are also on the State of Hawaii Injurious Species list, making it illegal to release or transport them to other parts of the state or export them without a permit.</p><p>Residents are urged to help prevent the bulbul from becoming established on Maui by reporting any sightings to 643pest.org or by calling (808) 643-PEST (7378). Clear descriptions of the bird, time and place observed and photos and videos are helpful when submitting reports.</p><p>For more information, call (808) 573-MISC (6472) or email miscpr@hawaii.edu.</p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a><p>The Maui News Maui County Department of Finance Director Scott Teruya was placed on administrative leave on last ...</p><a href=#></a><p>Holy Innocents Episcopal Church, formerly on Front Street in Lahaina Town and destroyed by the fire, announced the ...</p><a href=#></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3UoqWer6NjsLC5jqecsKtfobykrctmpZ6vo2R%2FcX6QaGhrZ5ietKm42Gagp66RqLa3sYyboKucXai9sMDTnptmp55iuqLByGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-file-for-temporary-custody-in-oklahoma.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How To File For Temporary Custody In Oklahoma</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./debartolo-family-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Debartolo Family Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
