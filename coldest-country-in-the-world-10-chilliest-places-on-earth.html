Here is a list of the coldest countries in the world.</p><h3>1. Antarctica</h3><p class=align-left>It doesn't get much colder than Antarctica, the coldest place on earth. Temperatures here can drop below -70 degrees Fahrenheit (-56 degrees Celsius). Yet it is still home to penguins and other wildlife adapted to survive in these extreme conditions. The coolest temperature was recorded on 21 July 1983 at Vostok station. It was as low as −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F).</p><h3>2. Russia</h3><p class=align-left>The capital city of Russia, Moscow, has an average January temperature of -8.6°C (16.52°F). In addition to being the coldest country in the world, it is one of the driest, with only a few centimetres of snow annually.</p><p class=align-left>In certain areas, such as Central Asia and Siberia, snow can last up to a year without melting. As a result, the mountains in these regions are said to be permanently covered by ice, earning them the <a href=#>nickname</a> "the world's roof". But even more astounding, Tibet's mountain glaciers are receding at unprecedented rates due to climate change.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a953f95e19f70c89.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>UN chief says world paying 'horrific price' for fossil fuels folly</span></p></a><h3>3.

The northwest territories comprise 1.3 million square miles of territory that are not accessible by car in winter.</p><p class=align-left>It will get you chilly - even without the Arctic air. Temperatures average between -28°C to cold temperatures in Ucluelet with 9°C during the day. At night, the range is 3°C in Ucluelet and -35°C in Alert.</p><h3>4. Kazakhstan</h3><p class=align-left>Located at the intersection of China, Russia, and the Middle East, Kazakhstan borders four time zones with an extremely high number of ethnic groups. It is also one of the most diverse and coolest countries in the world.</p><p class=align-left>The coldest inhabited place in Soltustik is where residents report that even though they get below-zero temperatures in winter, they manage to find ways to keep warm.

This is because many heat sources are indoors, from wood fires to natural gas.</p><p class=align-left>In some villages near Lake Issyk Kul, homes are heated by hot springs that come from under the ground and can be as hot as 100 degrees Celsius. However, this resource has been declining because of mining operations in the region.</p><h3>5. Estonia</h3><p class=align-left>In the frigid northern country of Estonia, average temperatures in the winter are as low as 2°F (-17°C). It can be largely attributed to its long and dark winters.</p><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">coldest temperature recorded</a> is -43.5 degrees Celsius. Its summer season is quite brief, with average temperatures only around 60°F (16°C).</p><p class=align-left>Many visitors <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1199824-20-expensive-hotels-nigeria-night.html href=#>enjoy visiting</a> in May when there are longer days, blooming flowers everywhere, lively folk <a href=#>music</a> festivals and delicious wild berries available for picking.</p><h3>6.

While it may be one of the coldest countries on earth, Greenland has some natural resources that give it economic potential—aluminium ore and diamonds.</p><p class=align-left>The coldest recorded temperature was -69.6°C on 22 December 1991 in the Northern Hemisphere.</p><h3>7. Iceland</h3><p class=align-left>The country is known for its frigid winters and snow-covered landscapes. It is also home to the northernmost capital in the world, Reykjavik. The coldest month of the year is January, with an average temperature of 3 degrees Celsius (37.4 degrees Fahrenheit).</p><p class=align-left>Iceland has a much warmer climate than its colder counterparts, like Canada and Russia, but it is still not exactly a tropical destination.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6cb1b3423d154ba1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Facing beleaguered Europe, Norway keen to protect energy windfall</span></p></a><h3>8. Mongolia</h3><p class=align-left>When the winter months hit Mongolia, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">temperatures can drop to</a> -40 degrees Fahrenheit. Snowfall starts in October and can accumulate up to two meters by March.</p><p class=align-left>Imagine waking up <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1284631-cute-good-morning-messages-for-her-to-make-her-smile.html href=#>each morning</a> wearing multiple layers of clothes to go outside.

The United States</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/725a16fca7ff5620.jpg><p class=align-left>Don't let America's geographical position deceive you.

Finland</h3><p class=align-left>In an average winter, temperatures in Finland can reach as low as -40°C. If it feels chilly, remember that residents must stay outside in these conditions—especially if they are farmers.</p><p class=align-left>The cold never stops Finns from getting work done or enjoying themselves. Most Finns don't mind the cold weather, claiming the Finnish climate makes them tough and resilient people. Some even say the cold winters give them a sense of peace.</p><h2>Which country has winter throughout the year?</h2><p class=align-left>Kazakhstan is the coldest country in the world. It has winters all year long. It is a landlocked country that borders Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. The terrain of this sparsely populated country consists mostly of mountains with rivers and lakes at higher elevations.</p><p class=align-left>There are plenty of amazing, welcoming places in the world with mild climates. That said, there are also regions of the planet where you can easily get frostbite from standing out in the sun for too long without putting on a coat or boots. The above countries may not be your first choice for a vacation destination, but if you want to experience true winter and want to know what the coldest country in the world is, pay a visit to one of the above.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6b69a8c5c6a4a6a4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Animals of the Red Book of Kazakhstan: a comprehensive list</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>Top 20 richest states in Nigeria in 2022: What are their current GDPs?</a></p><p class=align-left>Legit.ng recently published an article on Nigeria's top 20 <a href=#>richest states</a> in 2022.
