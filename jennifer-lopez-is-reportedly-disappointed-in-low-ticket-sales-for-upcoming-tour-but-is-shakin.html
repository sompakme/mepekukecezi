(In addition to the album, a musical film was released on the same day and, later in February, a documentary about the project.) This Is Me…Now—a follow up to 2002’s This Is Me…Then—debuted at No. 38 on the Billboard 200, which Us Weekly reports is the lowest any of Lopez’s nine studio albums have ranked.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYfNQgbv2KspNGyepEVgVA-1920-80.jpg><p>Throughout her 30-plus year career in entertainment, the source noted that Lopez has been through “plenty of problems like this before and has gotten over them,” and added “She moves on when things like this happen.”</p><p>Last month, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/jennifer-lopez-quietly-cancels-seven-shows/><u>Marie Claire</u></a> reported that Lopez canceled several shows for her upcoming tour—her first in five years—with the reported reason being low ticket sales. Stops at the end of her tour in Nashville, Raleigh, Atlanta, Tampa, and New Orleans were scheduled to take place between August 22 and August 30 and were canceled without explanation; according to Ticketmaster, there are no plans for the shows to be rescheduled. The revised tour schedule will still kick off the show on June 26 in Orlando but will now end in New York City, Lopez’s hometown.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/92bjPEAhf8ACV4xSF7NoTC-1920-80.jpg><p>Disappointed though she may be, it’s full steam ahead into her next ventures, the source said. “Jennifer is extremely proud of all the hard work she puts into her projects, and Ben [Affleck, her husband] has been a huge support through it all,” they said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xuuw5r6cs9uchh2YVth8WB-1920-80.jpg><p>Lopez and Affleck are currently house hunting in New York City, and Lopez is focused on her next movie, Kiss of the Spider Woman, which she’s already filming in New Jersey.

The design featured a pink silk satin skirt and the entire creation, including its floral collar, was made entirely by hand, People reports.</p><p>Of the ups and downs of the year, “She really doesn’t care what others think,” the source speaking to Us Weekly said. “She’s looking for a fresh start,” adding that Affleck has been keeping “Jen grounded” through it all. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A9c3akhK9DZcqwigzc6cw9-1920-80.jpg><p>The tour kicks off June 26, the same month that Lopez’s debut album, On the 6, turns 25 years old.
