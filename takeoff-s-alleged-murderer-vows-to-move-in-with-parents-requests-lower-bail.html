As he awaits trial, he's been given a hefty <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">$2 million bail</a> fee. His lawyer, Carl Moore, simply doesn't think his client can pay that much.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to TMZ, the accused murderer filed a motion on Monday (December 12) in Texas. The documents reveal that he's seeking to have his bond significantly taken down to just $100K.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Clark says he'll be able to pull these funds together with the help of a professional bondsman. Additionally, he's promising to live with his parents upon release, where he was apparently previously residing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Moore has assured the court that his client will wear a GPS monitor at all times. He'll also be responsible for following a curfew from a judge – if his motion earns approval, that is. To ensure he doesn't attempt to flee the country (again), Clark is willing to surrender his passport.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Another clause in the potential deal states that he'll follow any "no contact" order that comes his way with respect to different people.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It remains unclear what the odds of Clark making bail currently are. Before being taken into custody, reports say that he was attempting to get an emergency passport. At the same time, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Takeoff</a>'s murder investigation was unfolding and his family was in mourning.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Just last week, a judge gave the DJ $5,000. The money will go toward a private investigator. At this time, Patrick seems eager to prove that he was framed. Many of those closest to him were in shock when news of the charges came out, reports say.</p><p>Takeoff of the music group Migos performs on stage at American Airlines Arena on November 13, 2018 in Miami, Florida.
