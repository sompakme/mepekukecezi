Jones</a></strong>‘ <a href=#>video testimonial for religious group</a> the Forerunner Chronicles — in which he trashed <a href=# id=auto-tag_two-a-men data-tag=two-a-men>Two and a Half Men</a> as “filth” and said he no longer wanted to act on the CBS sitcom — came as a shock. But the man behind the Christian organization has long been at odds with Hollywood, pop culture and liberal America.</p><p><strong>Christopher Hudson</strong>, who calls himself the Forerunner, is a Seventh-day Adventist who is famous for the fiery sermons he gives in YouTube videos. In 2009, he gained notice for publishing online a <a href=# rel=nofollow>documentary called The Jay-Z Deception</a>, in which he accused the rap star of being a Freemason who released his Blueprint albums to celebrate his journey up the ranks of the organization and his links with Satan. He also says <strong>Kanye West </strong>and <strong>Rihanna </strong>are part of the conspiracy.</p><p><a href=#><strong>STORY: Angus T. Jones Will Not Appear in Next Two ‘Two and a Half Men’ Episodes</strong></a></p><p>As Hudson alleged in an interview in 2009, Satan is “using mediums like the music and the fashion industry, which are enticing to us on a very base level, dealing with our senses to draw us out of a reasonable, rational relationship with God.”</p><p>In The Jay-Z Deception, he says: “The Blueprint albums are markers in obtaining degrees in the secret organization known as the Freemasons.” The 2001 first album, he alleged, marked <strong>Jay-Z</strong>‘s acceptance into the organization, while the second album a year later marked his step up in the group. He said the third album — released seven years after The Blueprint 2 — marked the rapper’s obtaining of the Third Degree in the organization, which meant that he could lead lodge meetings.</p><p>Hudson was very much opposed to <strong>President Obama</strong>‘s re-election, and afterward posted a video urging supporters to open their eyes to the coming menaces of gay marriage, marijuana legalization and the damage done by Hurricane Sandy.</p><p>In 2011, he <a href=# rel=nofollow>claimed</a> that reports of the death of <strong>Osama bin Laden</strong> were part of a conspiracy and that the terrorist mastermind had been dead since 2007. In 2009, Hudson <a href=# rel=nofollow>released a video</a> in which he called masturbation an “unnatural act.” In the video, called “Voice of a Prophesy,” Jones said that he is still a virgin.</p><p>The actor described turning to religion during his parents’ divorce, after experimenting with drugs.</p><p>“When I look back now, I see that … the enemy was trying to push me in a different direction,” Jones said. “But God … pulled me out right at the last second.”</p><p>Hudson has also claimed that the death of <strong>Michael Jackson</strong> was a conspiracy, <a href=# rel=nofollow>calling it a cover-up</a> for the pope’s proposing a “new world order.” He said the pop star’s July 7, 2009, <a href=#>memorial service</a> was a distraction for <strong><span class=st>Pope Benedict XVI</span></strong>‘s call — in a document issued that same day — for a global political body to help pull the world out of the economic crisis.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKe70Z6prqaemr9ur8erpqehk6GytHnCoamiq12dwqW%2FzqdkmqaXqsBuf5htbGpqXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./infamous-donald-trump-golden-shower-video-probably-does-exist-says-christopher-steele.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Infamous Donald Trump 'golden shower' video 'probably does exist' says Christopher Steele</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hill-billy-brands-shark-tank-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hill Billy Brands Shark Tank Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
