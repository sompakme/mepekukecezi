Although these time-saving <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>beauty tools</a> were once novel, there are now dozens of options out there promising to bring us life-changing results.

For every hot air brush, we had a mix of InStyle editors, along with <strong>a professional hair stylist</strong> and a hair model, for a total of three individuals<strong> identifying as type 1, type 2, and type 3 hair</strong>, to test each brush.<strong> </strong>In order to understand what hair category you fall into, you can use the graph below. We’ve outlined our experiences and results below by hair type for you to select the styling tool that best suits your hair type and texture. We also enlisted the help of a number of hair professionals who provided tips on how to achieve salon-esque blowouts for the days you want to look like a 10, while only spending 10 minutes styling.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-shark-flexstyle-air-styling-and-drying-system></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shark FlexStyle Air Styling and Drying System</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shark FlexStyle Air Styling and Drying System" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jbofyDInjSBn2vDgNkzNe1Y9BT0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shark-flexstyle-air-styling-and-drying-system-880d1fc7d12440dd913f1252e8fcffc2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There are four different attachments and a multitude of heat and air pressure settings.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There isn’t much traction on the handle making it slightly difficult to have a hold on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 1:</strong> We’re impressed — from the ergonomics to the versatility, the heat and pressure options to the final result — this styling tool had both our hair stylist and our model chanting wow in unison. No matter the hair type, the Shark Airt Styling device created airbrushed hair that was simply chef’s kiss. A few things we particularly liked: There is an “L” and an “R” label indicating which side the curl wraps into. For short hair, the round brush attachment was a little larger than preferred as we would have loved to create tighter curls. Still, there’s no complaining about the salon-esque blowout that it achieved. We loved how easy it was to attach the various nozzles as well, which is a huge upgrade from some of the other hot air brushes we’ve tried.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 2: </strong>There’s nothing this device can’t do. It can be used as a regular blow dryer by twisting the rod at a 90-degree angle. When we were ready to style, we attached one of the four nozzles and got to working in the curls. On our slighter thicker hair, the brush doesn’t quite glide smoothly but it’s nothing too cumbersome, especially when considering the flawless results. Our hair was significantly smoother, straighter, and less frizzy than when using a regular blow dryer. Our method was using the blow dryer mode to get it 80 percent dry, then adding the brush attachment to do the last 20 percent and style it. This method took about ten minutes to complete which used to take 30 minutes and three different tools in the past — simply amazing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 3:</strong> Even on type 3 hair, the Shark tool aced its assignment with flying colors. Much like we experienced on type 2 hair, it doesn’t glide particularly smoothly through the hair. This didn’t bother us as, again, the results were impeccable. A glossy finish on our normally coarse hair could be found. The frizz wasn’t completely gone, but far less compared to when we were using other styling tools. What was truly mind-blowing was how fast everything was completed. We timed it to 13 minutes (!!) and the results lasted a whole three days. Our hair became incredibly bouncy which simply boosted our confidence. On top of all of this, the device is quite lightweight.</p><span id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Stylist Tip</span><p>Despite having decades of experience, this brush managed to blow our hair stylist away, calling it top-tier and exceeding her expectations. The multiple attachments can cater to the client’s hair, and the brush itself swivels into a 90 degree angle making maneuvering around the head a breeze. A cool shot helped to set the style and create a sleek look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings:</strong> 4 | <strong>Bristle Type: </strong>Boar | <strong>Cool Shot: </strong>Yes | <strong>Cord Length: </strong>96 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Weight: </strong>1.54 lbs | <strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1.25 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-hot-tools-24k-gold-one-step-blowout-and-volumizer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hot Tools Gold One-Step Blowout and Volumizer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hot Tools 24K Gold One-Step Blowout and Volumizer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/j1gNYbOfqzv4SJRTN7U5iUZqxuM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hot-tools-24k-gold-one-step-blowout-and-volumizer-61c7292a84e648c38e5e644a4da9fe33.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It glides through hair smoothly and easily.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It can get a little uncomfortably hot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 1: </strong>We had nothing but great things to say here. Ever since receiving this Hot Tools blowdryer, all our other hot styling tools have gone untouched in our cabinet. It’s because this device cut down our usual drying and styling session time in half (from 15–20 minutes to seven minutes). Not only that, but the results were much more appealing, with less frizz and smoother, healthier ends compared to when styled with a traditional blow dryer. The extra volume it created also awarded it five stars in our books. The bristles were extra gentle on our fine hair, not tugging or ripping delicate hair out, making the experience painless.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><br><strong>Type 2: </strong>We had similar experiences with our type 2 (and fine) hair. With our hair properly sectioned, the brush’s strong bristles got through chunks of hair quite smoothly. We were able to tame the curls and frizz to create a fuller yet sleeker texture. It was not only fun but easy to add curls that go both inward and outward to create that professional look. We were also impressed with the quality of the product — it was a very heavy-duty tool that did not feel cheap or easy to break. One thing to note was that the highest heat setting made the device squeal a little loudly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><br><strong>Type 3</strong>: On our curly, fine, and frizzy hair, we were pleasantly surprised with how evenly the heat distributed and as a result, tamed the locks effortlessly. Much like our previous two experiences, the brush got through our hair sans-tugging. Even after weekly use, the bristles didn’t look to be destroyed as we had experienced with some other brands. With frizz being one of our biggest concerns, this tool flattened flyaways and added a much-desired shine. We did think the tool got quite hot and sometimes uncomfortably so at the roots, so just be careful not to stay in one section for too long. At $75, the tool is the equivalent cost of two salon blowouts, making it a great bang for your buck.&nbsp;</p><span id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Stylist Tip</span><p>This tool impressed our hair stylist quite a lot, noting that it glided through hair like butter while serving consistent and powerful airflow. It gets the job done quickly and efficiently, and she would 100 percent recommend this product to consumers. Although she recommends being mindful of the heat, the device certainly creates that smooth finish it promises.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings:</strong> 3 | <strong>Bristle Type: </strong>Boartech, charcoal-infused<strong> </strong>| <strong>Cool Shot:</strong> Yes | <strong>Cord Length: </strong>96 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 2 lbs | <strong>Barrel Size: </strong>2.8 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-short-hair-revlon-one-step-volumizer-plus-20-hair-dryer-and-hot-air-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Short Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Revlon One-Step Volumizer Plus 2.0</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Revlon One-Step Volumizer PLUS 2.0 Hair Dryer and Hot Air Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7xPKNB4xnFPE9bYg8ybojlzyR6k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/revlon-one-step-hair-dryer-and-styler-plus-20-bd5bbece93f6459e9a080e5f1618a8a9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s extremely fast and effective, particularly for type 1 and 2 hair.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The brush can get a little hot and heavy to hold for extended periods.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 1: </strong>The Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer was extremely easy to use, so anyone who’s a beginner at styling their hair will love this piece. It only took about 10 minutes to completely dry the hair and we were impressed with just how efficient it was. Significantly reducing frizz, we were able to create a beautiful blowout with volume at the roots that lasted well into the second day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 2: </strong>On our curly yet thin hair, this divide achieved a shine and smoothness otherwise only attainable with a curling rod. Much like with our type 1 hair, the hot air brush went through the whole head of hair in under 10 minutes. Despite getting almost uncomfortably hot, the dryer didn’t fry or overwork the hair. The beautiful curls that were created also lasted longer than they typically would with a standard blow dryer and brush combo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 3: </strong>Perhaps this was not the best option for women with type 3 hair. Although the ergonomics were great (loved that we only needed one hand to go through everything) it neither brushed well (we needed to detangle the hair prior to using the brush) nor did it create a desirable end-look. The hair remained rather frizzy, and while the tips turned crisp and dry the roots remained a little moist. The airflow was simply not strong enough to be considered effective on this hair type. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><span id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Stylist Tip</span><p>The brush portion can smoothly go through hair for the most part, but the device itself is a little hot and heavy (too much to the point where it can get uncomfortable to hold for an extended period).

And while it had some strong pros — like creating a stunning straight-out-of-the-salon blowout thanks to its evenly distributed and powerful airflow, there were also some cons. The brush portion had some trouble gliding through the strands and would occasionally get stuck. It also didn’t create that silky finish on the naturally frizzy hair. Flyaways were present after completing the styling session which could only be tamed via a curling rod. Still, we were impressed with the ease of use, ergonomics, and design of the product — as a matter of fact it was the best we’ve ever seen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 2: </strong>This hair type is the Dyson Airwrap’s best friend. In just under 30 minutes, our hair achieved its desired look. And compared to other devices we’ve used in the past, this one added an effortless volume to the roots (while being super gentle on the scalp). It glided beautifully through the hair no matter which of the attachments were used. The consistency and heat distribution were amazing making even the lowest heat setting effective and thus, sparing us unnecessarily overheating our precious hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 3: </strong>Compared to other styling products we’ve tried on 3b/3c natural hair, the Dyson Airwrap was much easier to handle and achieved the desired shiny and smooth look. Not only did it look better, but it lasted longer, holding onto the style even after a full night’s rest. The wand was very much like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair dryer</a> and a curling iron at once, but without completely burning the hair.</p><span id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Stylist Tip</span><p>The Dyson Airwrap is lightweight and has a good grip, making it easy to maneuver around the head.

We recommend this for short hair, however, because the airflow power is not as strong as some of the other brands we tested and may take too long to go through long hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 2: </strong>Never did we think we could achieve hair-salon-esque styles from our bathrooms, yet here we are. We were blown away at how well this worked on type 2 hair, creating a super smooth and shiny finish in just over five minutes. Not only that, but we noticed more body in the hair as well. We do want to caveat that this hair was on the thinner side to begin with, which makes it easier to add volume.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 3: </strong>We were impressed with how well this hot air brush worked on type 3 hair as well. They didn’t snag any of our curls and instead created smooth strands with bouncy curly ends. We did notice some frizz or flyaways, but a few drops of hair oil and one more pass with the dryer almost instantly resolved that issue. Much like with our type 1 hair, we do wish the hottest setting was slightly hotter so that we could really get the kinky parts, but it was nothing that bothered us too much.</p><span id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Stylist Tip</span><p>It was very easy to switch heat settings using the dial at the bottom of the wand, and because the device is so lightweight and easy to grip, it was one of the most user-friendly blow dryers we tested on site.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings:</strong> 2 | <strong>Bristle Type: </strong>Nylon and tufted | <strong>Cool Shot:</strong> Yes | <strong>Cord Length: </strong>88 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 1.4 lbs | <strong>Barrel Size: </strong>3 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-volume-drybar-reserve-3-in-1-interchangeable-blow-dryer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Volume</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drybar 3-In-1 Interchangeable Blow Dryer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Drybar Reserve 3-In-1 Interchangeable Blow Dryer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/r5fEu-esunJ4nrTUcmUNY0zXSFU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/drybar-reserve-3-in-1-interchangeable-blow-dryer-d49c5a65114e4100a19b05ae5bff56f7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Drybar</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s pleasantly lightweight and it never gets unbearably hot to the point that it fries our hair.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The coolshot button gets accidentally activated mid-styling session because of where the button is located on the barrel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 1: </strong>From the get-go, we appreciated how high-end and easy-to-use this blow dryer was. It took three bulky products and merged them into one lightweight (and beautiful) hair styling tool. It never got too hot which made it possible to touch the other end of the tool while styling our hair. The airflow itself (of which there are three strengths) was also consistent and not overpowering. Out of the four heat settings, the highest heat didn’t feel volcanic, so it simply took a bit longer to fully dry our heads. In return, it didn’t fry our hair, making it feel healthier overall. The end-result was a stunning healthy glow, not unlike what we achieve at a salon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 2: </strong>Up until now we’ve been using powerful blow dryers on our slightly thicker hair, so in comparison, the Drybar felt a little weak. Still, because we didn’t have to go in with a second tool to style after drying, in total this actually reduced the time to achieve our desired look. We can’t confidently say this took away any frizz or created a smooth surface on this hair type, but it certainly was an elevated experience and a much more seamless process thanks to its lightweight body and styling nozzles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 3: </strong>The best part of this hot air brush was that it glided through our type 3 hair effortlessly. Our tester here has thick hair that frequently gets knotted, so the fact that it never tangled was a big feat. And although it tamed the mane it did not completely remove the frizz, which was an experience we felt with type 2 hair as well. Still, having the lower heat and airflow settings made it easier to style our bangs, and the overall results were very appealing. A surprise benefit was how soft and bouncy it made our curls — we couldn’t stop touching it! Out of all the hot hair styling tools this particular tester tried in her lifetime, the Drybar Reserve was by far the best.</p><span id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Stylist Tip</span><p>We noticed that the cool shot button is right where the fingers rest, which accidentally caused us to switch to cool mid-styling session a few times. Still, as someone with tons of experience dealing with all types of hair tools, this option stood out for its lightweight body and ease of use. Everything glided smoothly and the nice long cord was a plus.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heat Settings:</strong> 4 | <strong>Bristle Type: </strong>Nylon and tufted | <strong>Cool Shot: </strong>Yes | <strong>Cord Length: </strong>108 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Weight: </strong>1 lb | <strong>Barrel Size: </strong>2.44 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fine-hair-bondi-boost-blowout-brush-pro></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Fine Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bondi Boost Blowout Brush Pro</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bondi Boost Blowout Brush Pro" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/K1fkIdhPknd0oi975OGdfjJwRJA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bondi-boost-blowout-brush-pro-358fc7110e984c6db4ff1be35819e50b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It can brush through thick, coarse, and curly hair like it’s nothing.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not the best option for people with thin or fine hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 1: </strong>The Bondi Boost Blowout did well in straightening the hair and creating smooth lines. That being said, it fared better with our thicker hair than our thin hair. The fine strands were perhaps too fine for the bristles and they kept getting stuck between them. And while we appreciated the silky straight look in the end, we would have loved to see a little more volume that typically comes with a blowout.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 2: </strong>Simple, easy to handle, and quick to deliver results, we loved the whole process from start to finish. The brush was very self-explanatory to use, and the handle was comfortable to grip as it curved into the hand. The air never got too hot and the detangling nylon tip allowed for a pleasant, no-tug brushing session. In the mirror we were met with a very sleek and shiny result, not unlike an effortless 90’s supermodel. The curved brush made everything a breeze to style and the ends looked more natural than that with a curling iron.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type 3: </strong>We’re quite amazed at what a brush under $60 could do for curly hair. To begin, this completed a job that typically takes a good hour (blow drying and then styling with a curling wand) in 32 minutes. This opened up the opportunity to create a fresh blowout in the morning and save precious time. Our thick, coarse, and curly hair typically tangles or knots easily and takes a skilled hand to brush — but the Bondi Boost seemed to have no issues gliding right through. The final result was a shiny and smooth finish (although the Oribe heat protectant spray probably played a role in that). We completely swapped this product in for our usual hair blow dryer and after several weeks, we actually think it made our hair look healthier and refreshed.</p><span id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Stylist Tip</span><p>For a budget brush, our stylist was very impressed with the ergonomics and results of this brush. The tip remains cool so it’s easy to hold. The airflow is not particularly strong but that helps to protect the hair from burning.

A brush with multiple heat settings also means it can work across all hair types and textures without causing any damage.<p>Fine and thin hair already dries without much effort, so blasting it with extremely high heat will make them vulnerable and more prone to damage. Lower heat settings work best on fine or damaged hair to keep it safe and healthy. Those with thick, coarse or curly hair will need a higher heat setting to get a soft, smooth finish.</p><p>Regardless of your hair type, finishing your blowout with a cool shot blast will lock your style in place. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Michael Dueñas</a>, celebrity hair stylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Veluer Creative</a>, recommends picking a hot air brush with at least two temperature settings because not all hair textures require the same amount of heat. Being able to toggle between temperatures as you style reduces harmful exposure and brings healthier hair to all.</p></li><li><strong>Bristles:</strong> In terms of design, look for a brush with firm and evenly spaced bristles, which will prevent hair from getting caught as you run the brush through your hair. Material-wise, A mix of materials, like boar and nylon, will untangle hair and impart shine with each stroke. If your hair is prone to knots, plastic-capped bristles will gently remove snags without tugging. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Raven Hurtado</a>, a stylist at Maxine Salon in Chicago, recommends that anyone with long or thick hair should consider a hot air brush that has ceramic or titanium bristles, as they will add even more shine.</li><li><strong>Cool Shot: </strong>If you’ve been ignoring the cool shot button on your hot tools, you’ve been missing out on serious shine and longevity. This setting will really help set and style your hair to keep it in place all day. Hurtado explains when you top off your drying and styling session with a blast of cool air, it closes the cuticle and helps prevent frizz, leaving your hair with a shiny smooth finish.<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the difference between a hot brush and a hot air brush?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“A hot brush is usually radiant heat or infrared heat and can not be used on wet hair,” says Dueñas, who adds that a hot air brush is just it sounds — it’s a bristled brush that heats up and blows air to straighten and smooth dry or slightly damp hair. “The hot hair brush is round, and you have to manually rotate so you get more lift and bounce with volume,” adds Hurtado.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes these tools include attachments, like a paddle or round brush, so you can create a variety of different looks while drying the hair at the same time, making the entire process more efficient.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re only choosing a brush with one attachment, Dueñas tells us to look for one with a cylinder shape because it allows you to wrap your hair around it, thus creating more volume.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is it okay to use a hot air brush every day?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Short answer: Yes, says Dueñas, who adds that “If you start to feel damage in your hair, as with any blow dryer, add a heat protectant to wet hair before styling.” He also recommends opting for a hot air brush with at least two temperature settings, so you’re not frying hair at high temperatures every day.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do you use a hot air brush on wet or dry hair?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike a hot brush, a hot air brush replaces your blow dryer, so it’s safe to use on wet or dry hair, says Dueñas.
