The Netflix series about a mother and daughter pair settling into a new life in a new town has drawn plenty of comparisons to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/gilmore-girls/>Gilmore Girls</a>, including in its similarly idyllic New England backdrop.</p><p>Much like Stars Hollow,&nbsp;Ginny & Georgia's Wellsbury is filled with quirky characters (including a flannel-shirted restaurant owner-slash-love interest), small-town vibes, and postcard-perfect vistas. Unlike Rory and Lorelai's status as basically the princesses of their cute Connecticut hamlet, however,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a35614702/who-is-antonia-gentry-ginny-and-georgia/>Ginny (Antonia Gentry)</a>&nbsp;and Georgia (Brianne Howey) are met with suspicion, judgment, and casual racism after moving to Massachusetts, making it a lot less cute, to say the least.</p><p>Still, minus its very flawed residents, Wellsbury still makes a pretty spectacular backdrop for the show, offering at least a little bit of serenity amid the increasingly off-the-rails plotlines of the series. Interested in packing up your own life and moving across the country after the suspicious death of your husband? Here's what you need to know about the real-life Wellsbury, Mass.</p><h2 id=is-wellsbury-a-real-place-3>Is Wellsbury a real place?</h2><p>Sadly, in the grand tradition of Stars Hollow,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a34955090/is-capeside-dawsons-creek-real/>Dawson's Creek</a><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a34955090/is-capeside-dawsons-creek-real/>'s Capeside</a>, and so many other adorable onscreen New England towns before it, Wellsbury doesn't actually exist. That said, Massachusetts&nbsp;is&nbsp;home to small towns like Wellesley and West Newbury, as&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://decider.com/2021/02/24/ginny-georgia-filming-location-is-wellsbury-real/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Decider</a>&nbsp;notes, which will get you halfway there!</p><p>But while this means you can't grab a coffee or a glass of wine (or three) at the Blue Farm CafÃ©, there's still a way to soak up all of Wellsbury's small-town vibesâ€”you'll just need a valid passport to get there.</p><h2 id=so-where-was-xa0-ginny-amp-georgia-xa0-actually-filmed-3>So, where was&nbsp;Ginny & Georgia&nbsp;actually filmed?</h2><p>In a twist more dramatic than the ending of the show's first season (sort of), not only is Wellsbury not in Massachusetts, but it's not even in the U.S. The show was shot largely on indoor sound stages at Toronto's TriBro Studios, according to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10813940/locations referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>IMDb</a>, and the nearby Ontario town of Cobourg stood in for Wellsbury the rest of the time.</p><p>A&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.cobourgnow.com/?p=10520" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Cobourg Now</a>&nbsp;report from August 2019 warned residents that the show would be filming in several parts of the waterfront town, which has been around since 1798 and is known as "the gem of Lake Ontario."&nbsp;Among those locations were Audrey's In Town Fashions, which served as the boutique where Ginny gets caught taking a five-finger discount; El Camino restaurant, which was transformed into the Blue Farm CafÃ©; the defunct Nelson A. Boylen Collegiate Institute in Toronto, which became Wellsbury High; and the city's town hall, Victoria Hall, which became the Wellsbury Arts Center. The report also noted that all Canadian flags and mailboxes dotted throughout downtown Cobourg would be replaced with American ones.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><h2 id=how-did-cobourg-feel-about-pretending-to-be-american-3>How did Cobourg feel about pretending to be American?</h2><p>In typical Canadian fashion, the town appeared to be very polite about being infringed upon by its neighbors to the south. An August 2019 report from the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.northumberlandnews.com/news-story/9572495--ginny-and-georgia-filming-transforms-downtown-cobourg-into-new-england-town/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Northumberland News</a>&nbsp;seemed excited about Cobourg's role in the streaming series. And the official Twitter account for the town offered up a "fun reminder" around the same time that "we are still Cobourg, Canada!" despite the American flags infiltrating its downtown.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>COMMUNITY: We are still Cobourg, Canada! Just a fun reminder that @NetflixCanada2 is in town filming Ginny & Georgia.

Sara Waisglass, Raymond Ablack, Mason Temple, and&nbsp;Schitt's Creek's Jennifer Robertson, who play Maxine, Joe, Hunter, and Ellen, respectively, all hail from Canada.</p><h2 id=did-season-2-add-any-new-filming-locations-3>Did season 2 add any new filming locations?</h2><p>While the show's second season was mostly filmed in its establish season 1 locations, there were a few new locations, including Victoria Park near Coburg Beach, where Ginny had a de-stressing morning run. The famous Faneuil Hall in downtown Boston was also included as an establishing shot in the Christmas special, so the shopping mall is worth a look for any Ginny and Georgia fans based in New England.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGxtZmiDdX2UaK6hnaKaeqq%2FjKCgp6apYq6vsIygnKiql56ubrLIpaSenF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-wick-4-ending-explained-does-john-wick-die.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Wick 4 ending explained | Does John Wick die?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-old-is-the-oldest-wolf.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>How old is the oldest wolf?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
