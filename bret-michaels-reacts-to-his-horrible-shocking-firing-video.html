She ultimately turned against him, saying it would be her mission to take him down, and downplayed how much money he helped raise in the first challenge.</p><p>Also not helping matters, Trump repeatedly told Michaels he thought it was a bad decision for him to return as a player instead of a boardroom adviser, as past winners <strong>Piers Morgan, Joan Rivers, John Rich </strong>and<strong> Arsenio Hall</strong> chose to do.</p><p>In the boardroom, Trump also admitted, “Psychologically, it’s awfully hard for me to pick you again,” and Michaels was sent packing.</p><p>On Monday, Michaels — who called being fired “horrible” — reiterated that he wanted to return as a player instead of an adviser to try to raise more money for his charity, the Life Rocks Foundation-National Philanthropic Trust. He also confessed that he didn’t think Trump was serious when he fired him.</p><p>“I thought they were punking me,” he said. “I looked around to see what they were talking about.”</p><p>Michaels said one of his mistakes was in choosing Omarosa for his team, but he revealed that he had a solid rationale for doing so.</p><p><a href=#><strong>STORY: Donald Trump on ‘All-Star Celebrity Apprentice’: ‘It’s a Very Dramatic Season’</strong></a></p><p>“She is known as evil incarnate on TV,” he said. “I figured, if I embraced it and unleashed her on the other team, we would win this hands down until we had to fight each other. That grenade blew up in my hand.”</p><p>Still, he has nothing but praise for Trump and his family, noting that they have raised millions of dollars for charity.</p><p>Next, Michaels is gearing up for the release of his solo album <span class=st dir=ltr>Good Songs & Great Friends</span> and the launch of his new Travel Channel show, Rock My RV.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOnJylnZKntrXFjJqnqaqVo8Gqr8RmmaudpGK6qq%2FHmpylq12nsqKv06xkbWplboJ4ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bruce-willis-features-in-rare-family-video-with-young-daughters.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bruce Willis features in rare family video with young daughters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-young-and-the-restless-renewed-through-season-55-at-cbs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'The Young and the Restless' Renewed Through Season 55 at CBS</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
