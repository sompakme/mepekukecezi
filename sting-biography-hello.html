Nights were spent playing in local jazz clubs, where the striped 'bee-like' jerseys he wore earned him his long-standing moniker from fellow musicians.&nbsp;</p><p id=e24ju9kLuc data-wc=21>Once qualified, the teacher-turned-musician taught English by day and gigged the city's punk clubs by night with his band Last Exit.</p><p id=eLgO2mNZc0 data-wc=9><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Inside Sting and Trudie Styler's outrageous £7million estate</a>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c4c7a4834944-6270-sting.jpg><h2>Sting's band The Police</h2><p id=e8l4VCGFTh data-wc=46>He was also becoming increasingly disenchanted with the conventional life, however he'd married Frances Tomelty in 1976 and upped sticks again, relocating to London where he met drummer Stuart Copeland and guitarist Andy Summers, the duo with whom he would form legendary rock trio The Police.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezsws3azcZ data-wc=49>After a successful tour of the States during which they played the odd set in front of single-figure audiences, the band was signed by A&M records. Their first single, Roxanne, was a big hit leading the record company to rush to release a first album, Outlandos d'Amour, in 1979.&nbsp;</p><p id=ehJ5-oxsuIB data-wc=26>Their sophisticated take on the new wave sound was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic, and by 1982 The Police were filling 70,000-capacity stadiums.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sting's split from first wife</h2><p id=eM3ps4jNem data-wc=44>But something had to give, and it was Sting's two marriages to Frances and to The Police that came unravelled.
