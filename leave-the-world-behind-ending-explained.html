Adapted from Rumaan Alam’s 2020 novel of the same name, Esmail’s iteration, which quickly topped Netflix’s top 10 list when it debuted Dec. 8, follows Amanda and Clay Sandford, played by <a href=# id=auto-tag_julia-roberts data-tag=julia-roberts>Julia Roberts</a> and Ethan Hawke, who take their children Rose (Farrah Mackenzie) and Archie (Charlie Evans) on a weekend getaway to Long Island. While there, the owners of their luxe home rental, GH Scott (Mahershala Ali) and his daughter Ruth (Myha’la Herrold) return, citing a blackout back in the city. The families, between whom distrust and paranoia mounts, cohabit as society seemingly and eerily unravels around them.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Among the final shots of what Esmail has called a “cautionary tale” is one of the New York skyline erupting in smoke and flames — though what, exactly, is the cause and what will happen after remain elusive. Instead, the film, which counts the Obamas as producers, ends with young Rose watching Friends by herself in a neighbor’s basement bunker. The theme song, “I’ll Be There For You,” plays over the movie’s end credits. By contrast, Alam’s book concludes with Rose gathering supplies from the bunker before she presumably returns to her family. (“There’s no actual explanation offered in either version,” <a href=#>Alam noted earlier this fall</a>. “The difference is that I have access to the ability to tease the reader in a different way than Sam is able to tease the audience.”)</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Esmail accurately predicted what might come next. “We knew going into this that the ending was going to be polarizing, but we did not want to pull punches on it,” he told The Hollywood Reporter in mid-November, before the film had been released. “I think in a traditional disaster film, a genre that I’m a huge fan of, so no knock on disaster films — I mean, Day after Tomorrow is one of my favorite movies — but the expectation is at the end of these films, your cast of characters overcomes the disaster and the world reverts back to some sane semblance of normalcy. I knew that I wasn’t going to do that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Nevertheless, Esmail’s hope was those intense reactions would lead to conversation, which is precisely what he was after. “As a film lover, I’m excited when I leave a movie wanting to spend hours talking about it. And when you end a film with sort of a pat answer, where the heroes do overcome something, those tend to be the movies where they kind of come and go,” he says, adding: “So we knew making this film that we wanted to go in this provocative way, and we assumed the risk that it would divide people — and hopefully in a good way, because that provokes conversation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSfnZGpwrOx0mijnpmmmnq1tMRmrqiqnJl6o7HHoqWdZZSev6av06ipZquRonqmv8yaoKVlla29ra3Ip6pmm5%2BjwbO71Z6prKGRoXqmusOipaBlYWeAdoOVb2lyb18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-fun-things-to-do-in-central-massachusetts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Fun Things to Do in Central Massachusetts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./your-name-is-power-by-rend-collective.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Your Name Is Power by Rend Collective</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
