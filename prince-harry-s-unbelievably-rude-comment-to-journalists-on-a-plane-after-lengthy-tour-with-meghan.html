And often on these tours, there comes a point towards the end, when the royal might come back to the back of the plane and have a chat with us off the record, you know, not for printing, but it's a way of making bonds. It's a way of keeping us sweet. It's a way of having informal contact. And we were promised that he or they would come to the back of the plane, and it didn't happen. It didn't happen and this was a four or five-hour flight, ‘When's this gonna happen?’”</p><p><b><i>LISTEN: What Prince Harry said when told his 'rude' comment had upset the press</i></b></p><p id=eCbCLEvKZSm data-wc=94>He continued: “Then we were buckling up for the descent and we landed. And it hadn't happened. And only after we landed, they came back into the back of the plane. And Harry was slightly in front of Meghan, she was slightly behind him. And she didn't say much. She did make some strange remark about us wanting to get back for our Sunday lunch. And it was completely bizarre. But it’s what he said that was memorable. He said, ‘Thanks very much for coming, even though you weren't invited.’ And we thought, ‘What?’”</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">LOVE THE ROYALS?
