The song appeared on 2011’s “comeback album, ”THE SEA OF MEMORIES, which was BUSH’s first studio album in ten years.That year Billboard ran a story about the band under the headline, “Like They Never Left” – a fitting title as the multi-platinum quartet (vocalist/songwriter/guitarist Gavin Rossdale, guitarist Chris Traynor, bassist Corey Britz and drummer Nik Hughes) promptly picked up where they left off.
