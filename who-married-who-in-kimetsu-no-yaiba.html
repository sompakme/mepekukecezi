Despite Giyuu looking serious, he has an aloof and airheaded personality that people don't like.<h2>Who is Tanjiro's crush?</h2>But Demon Slayer introduced Tanjiro's main love interest briefly, and she doesn't really return until the end of the season, when she is fighting against him. His love interest that develops as the story goes on is Kanao Tsuyuri and their romance is quite adorable.<h2>Who is Kanao crush?</h2>It is implied in an extra chapter following the end of the Functional Recovery Training Arc that she may have had a crush on Tanjiro.<h2>Does Giyuu have a love interest?</h2>In the first season of the Demon Slayer anime, Giyu Tomioka is set next to Shinobu Kocho during the Natagumo Mountain Arc. Though Giyu is much too stoic to openly admit his admiration of Shinobu, it is clear that they share an interest in saving the demons who have had their lives stolen by Muzan Kibutsuji.<h2>Who married Mitsuri?</h2>In Chapter 205, we see Obanai and Mitsuri reincarnated and married, as they promised before they died, and they are running a restaurant together. In the volume extras it is revealed that they have five kids.<h2>Does Giyuu like Tanjiro?</h2>He is shown to care a lot for Tanjiro, which is further seen when he becomes greatly angered when Akaza attempts to kill Tanjiro, losing his usual stoic demeanour and jumping in to protect him from the Upper Rank.<h2>Does Shinobu like Suzu?</h2>Suzu. Shinobu has been Suzu's good friend since their early childhood. After Suzu had lost her mother to an accident at the age of six, Shinobu vouched to protect her from potential bullies who may make fun of her frequent crying.<h2>Does Giyuu like Shinobu?</h2>Although Giyu maintains a cold and distant stance, among all the pillars, Shinobu is the one who understands him the most and has the best relationship with him. Shinobu says that Giyuu is hated by other people, which can seem mean, but in reality she actually supports him.<h2>Who dies in Demon Slayer?</h2><p>Demon Slayer: 10 Saddest Deaths In The Manga</p><ul><li>Iguro Obanai. ...</li><li>Tamayo. ...</li><li>Kokushibo. ...</li><li>Gyomei Himejima. ...</li><li>Jigoro Kuwajima. ...</li><li>Shinobu Kocho. ...</li><li>Genya Shinazugawa. ...</li><li>Muichiro Tokito.</li></ul><h2>Did AOI like Tanjiro?</h2>Tanjiro Kamado<p>Aoi and Tanjiro seem to have formed a friendship.

She is currently 16 years old, making her older than Tanjiro.<h2>How many exes does Zenitsu have?</h2>Zenitsu's debt is estimated to be around 600,000 yen in modern currency. This massive amount of debt likely came from his 7 ex-girlfriends. Despite all of them being beautiful, they treated Zenitsu like a slave, tricked him as well as robbing him of his money. Zenitsu also never got to even hold their hands.<h2>Who is Giyuu sister?</h2>Tsutako Tomioka ( 冨 とみ 岡 おか 蔦 つた 子 こ , Tomioka Tsutako?) was the older sister of Giyu Tomioka.<h2>Who is rengoku girlfriend?</h2>Mitsuri Kanroji<p>The two of them share a gluttonous side and enjoyed snacking on their breaks. Mitsuri derived her own unique Breathing Style, Love Breathing, from his Flame Breathing.</p><h2>How old is Giyuu?</h2>At just 19 years old, Giyuu is considered the strongest of the nine Hashira.<h2>Who is Mitsuri's love interest?</h2>Obanai Iguro<p>Obanai is deeply in love with Mitsuri, as he has stated in the manga. He feels as if he can't tell her, however, this is because of his "filthy blood", caused by the trauma he had endured in the past. He first saw her when she stood under a sakura tree, which is where he fell in love with her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmalkae%2FqrHDZq6hp12eu263yKacraulYruwediaoJuZ</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-do-tennis-players-grunt.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why do tennis players grunt?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-luis-daniel-galvez-wiki-biography-age-height-girlfriend-parents-ethnicity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Luis Daniel Galvez?
