Furthermore, <a href=# rel>Martin Lawrence told fans he had spoken with Foxx and received a positive update</a>. <a href=# rel>Nick Cannon also provided a positive update on the star's condition</a>. However, new information appears to indicate that the situation was much more serious and was a true life-or-death situation for Foxx.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-foxx-revived-on-set-after-stroke>Foxx Revived On Set After Stroke</h2></span><p>According to sources who spoke to Radar Online, Foxx needed to be resuscitated after suffering his stroke. “Jamie suffered a serious medical episode and needed immediate attention,” the source said. “It was touch and go for days with him, and he had to be revived — he is very lucky to be alive!” the source said. It is unclear if the resuscitation happened on set or during his stay in the hospital. However, a stroke is a very serious medical event that can often have unforeseen complications after the initial incident. However, we cannot fully speculate on the specifics.</p><p>Additionally, the source also reportedly revealed the cause behind the stroke. “He’s very lucky he got the treatment he did,” they continued. “Jamie suffers from high blood pressure, which doctors say can cause clots in the brain, leading to a stroke. Doctors believe this was a long time coming, and really, if they hadn’t acted fast, Jamie might well have been a goner.” This means that the stroke was seemingly more severe than previously reported and had Foxx in critical condition at one point. However, it appears that the immediate danger has passed and that Foxx is on the mend. It remains unclear as to when Foxx will leave the hospital, or return to work. Regardless, the entertainment industry will be happy to hear he is on the mend despite a very scary moment a few weeks ago.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdma4N6hJJmoZqlmZp6p7vXsWSsrKKkuKZ5wJ2boqyZpLuiuIydnK2ZmaHA</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./richard-lugner-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Richard Lugner Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./it-s-not-about-weight-it-s-about-health.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Its Not About Weight, Its About Health</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
