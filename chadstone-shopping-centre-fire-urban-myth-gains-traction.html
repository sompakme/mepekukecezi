Ten vehicles parked near the burning car also caught fire and sustained significant damage.</p><p>Police quickly determined that the fire was non-suspicious, but social media was telling a different story.</p><p>The so-called “shocking rumour” began with a familiar story purportedly sent in a text message.

As such, we encourage the community to not share misinformation.”</p><p>Social media users confirmed they too had heard that rumour before.</p><p>“That’s been going round since the ’80s,” one wrote on Reddit.</p><p>Firefighters were called to the up-market shopping centre in Victoria’s southeast at about 1.40pm. Fifty firefighters were needed to bring the fire under control. There were initial difficulties gaining access to the blaze and a hose had to be fed down from the main road.</p><p>Parts of the centre was evacuated and shoppers were forced to wait several hours to return to their vehicles.</p><p>A nearby childcare centre was evacuated as thick smoke swept across the area.</p><p>Chadstone is the largest shopping centre in Australia, spanning 190,000sq m.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwwsicq6iqmZZ8r7HWrGacoJGZwLW7zZ5krKCfpb2qusZmmp6mpKeybq%2FAq2SpmaKgeqe10Z5krKyZp8Buwc9mmaKykae%2FpnnUq5mapl2ixrW0jqecsKtdqMGwvthomHBwYmh9eoHEbWppaWZpsqetwG2Zn5qWZX1xgcGaa3E%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-evans-42-marries-alba-baptista-26-at-star-studded-ceremony-in-cape-cod-report.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Evans, 42, marries Alba Baptista, 26, at star-studded ceremony in Cape Cod: Report</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alan-rickman-cause-of-death-age-parents-siblings-wife-children-height.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alan Rickman Cause of Death, Age, Parents, Siblings, Wife, Children, Height</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
