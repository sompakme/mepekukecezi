However, sometimes he elicits controversy with these collaborations. Back in the day, he did a lot of work with Detroit artists. Subsequently, after moving on to different styles, Yachty got hit with the colonizer allegations that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> sometimes receives. Moreover, the artist has been under fire in the past for the way he has spoken about hip-hop and the culture in general. Oftentimes, he has left a bad taste, even if he didn't mean anything inherently negative.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now, Yachty is catching some heat for his latest collaborator. Below, you can see that Yachty is working with Ian. For those who may not know, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Ian is a young white rapper whose entire schtick</a> is that he is a rich white kid from the suburbs. He also imitates flows from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chief Keef</a>, Yeat, and sometimes even <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Playboi Carti</a>. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">His new project Valedictorian</a> has proven to be a success, albeit a controversial one. Many see him as a culture vulture and everything that is wrong with the music industry today. Needless to say, you can see how Yachty working with him could elicit some anger.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lil-yachty-x-ian>Lil Yachty x Ian</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the quote tweets to the post from Kurrco above, fans were pretty livid with Yachty. The responses were cynical, and they showcased a general distaste with mainstream rappers taking Ian seriously. "If I find out you willingly listen to this industry plant, you’re getting cut off instantly," one person wrote. "Homie in the corner wanna say something so bad but you can tell he just a yes men like everyone else," said another.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-fans-react>Fans React</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of the backlash to Yachty working with Ian, in the comments section down below.
