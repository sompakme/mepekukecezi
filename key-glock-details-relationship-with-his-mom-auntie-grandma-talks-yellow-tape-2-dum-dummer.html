The South Memphis native has been rapping for six years now, beginning his career with the independently-released mixtape Whole Lotta Everything.&nbsp;Basically one full year after the mixtape's release, the rapper would&nbsp;drop his first project under cousin's Young Dolph's Paper Route Empire, with his hard-hitting trap-driven sound entirely intact. That is to say, Key Glock has pretty much always sounded like Key Glock. Case-in-point: listen to "Actin'" or "Zeros," two of his early songs, both referenced in our interview with the artist below.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Key Glock, born&nbsp;Markeyvius LaShun Cathey,&nbsp;never had&nbsp;any doubts that this is what he would end up doing, although the timeline, and how exactly he'd get there, was certainly up for debate.&nbsp;This much is evident from our Zoom video conversation, which he takes from the passenger seat of his yellow lambo-- although he needs to actually download the Zoom app before we can connect, because he's a rapper. Glock speaks openly about being raised by a bevy of strong women, from grandma, to great-grandma, to mom and aunties; these ladies made sure Glock did his part to complete high school before the rapper winded up in jail for a brief period of time. And once again, a female figure in his life stepped in to help him get back on track-- that is, his auntie, the same auntie who made him cousins with Young Dolph, called him up while he was still in jail and introduced the idea that Dolph wanted to connect to discuss music.&nbsp;</p><p><h6>Image provided by the artist.

The fact is, both Glock and Dolph deliver a particularly poignant strain of hip-hop that is hard to come by anywhere else. Their fanbase is cult-ish in its potency and dedication to either artists;&nbsp;and their disregard for a&nbsp;major label&nbsp;makes them that much stronger as artists and businessmen alike. If there is anyone rivaling Glock and Dolph in this space, it might be a fellow EMPIRE-signed rapper, who was actually a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">guest on On the Come Up last year</a>-- <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Money Man</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Nonetheless, today is all about Key Glock. Before you get 20 more songs on Yellow Tape 2, which Glock claims are even more energetic than the first Yellow Tape, it's time to get properly acquainted with Markeyvius by reading, or watching, our interview below.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h6>WATCH: Key Glock's On the Come Up episode</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>HNHH: Tell me about your early life in South Memphis.

Memphis taught me everything-- everything I know as far as about business, street life. It’s true when they say that there’s no place like home. I’m glad to say I’m from Memphis because the way we built down there, the way I’m built, I can go anywhere else and live, and adapt.</span> <span>Just because of how my hometown is set up, and how they breed us. Rough and fun.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>When you say you learned everything from the streets, what was your school situation like?

Me, personally, once I got to high school, I was like, “Sh*t, I know how to count, I know how to spell, I know how to write, I know how to read,” and I know how to do these things well. As far as algebra, pre-calc, and sh*t, I never understood it, because I was like, “I’m not finna be using these types of problems in everyday life.” I’m not gonna be like, what’s x - y = z times two? I’m not finna be doing that with money and in my finances. But I wasn’t no dummy.&nbsp; I was book smart. I got common sense.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>What would’ve been your favorite subject in school, if you had to pick?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>I laugh when I say this, but my favorite subject was probably fitness.

What was that like? What type of parent was she to you? Were there a lot of rules? And was she the only parent, the main parent growing up?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>I ain’t have a “main” parent because everybody loved me and everybody looked after me, so it wasn’t one that stood out over the other ones in my eyes. I never looked at it like that. But I was raised in a household of women. My mother was away, so I was living with my grandmother, who was my mother’s mother. My grandmother was living with her mother, which is my great grandmother. I was living with my grandmother and my great grandmother.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Oh wow, and eventually your mom came home.

Like I said, I was living with my grandmother and great grandmother, but my auntie was the third piece of the puzzle that completed me. I moved with her right before my mother came home, which was my senior year of high school. This was all my mother asked me to do, and my auntie was like, “You know you ain’t want to go to college, you know that ain’t your thing, but just get your diploma.” I was like, aight. To me, this sh*t ain’t nothing. I’m finna get that. That’s all? Okay! So that’s what it was.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>So I’m just trying to put it in context -- so you graduated high school-- I went back to your first song on Youtube, “Actin’”, which was like 8 years ago.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Like 2013.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>So that song-- you were in high school when you put that out, still.</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Right, 9th grade.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>You had already started rapping in 9th grade, I guess?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Yeah...but I wasn’t serious with it. I just had a name in the city, had a name in the streets, had a name in school. I was always popular, I had always been that guy. Everybody always knew who I was. I always had something going. I just wanted to do something right quick. Once I did it, I got so much feedback and great responses, it went to my head. I was like, “Aw yeah, this sh*t like nothing. I’m gonna take it and run with it.” And that’s exactly what I did. I just didn’t know it was gonna happen this quick. I always knew it was gonna happen though.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Was “Actin” the first song that got you thinking, like, ‘yeah, I can run with this, I can do this’?

It’s called “Don’t Deserve,” you can look it up and listen to it right now. I was so in love with that song. I just went on YouTube, typed in that beat, like “Gucci Mane Don’t Deserve It instrumental,” and god dammit, it was right there. I clicked on it, played it, and I was just listening to it. Like any other lil kid, I was just rapping and listening to a beat. Then I was like, “Man, I’m dropping this after school.” It was just eating me up inside because I loved that song so much. I was already a Gucci fanatic, so that’s how it went. That’s what started it off. I sent Gucci that song a couple months ago. I was like, “Bruh, you’re the reason I started rapping,” and I sent him this song we’re talking about right now, “Actin,” and he was like, “Yeah, you need to go back to that old sound, it was hard!” I’m like, “I’m still hard.” [</span><span>Laughs</span><span>]</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h6>LISTEN: Key Glock "Actin'"</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>That’s crazy.

She gon’ give it to me. I don’t even be knowing or thinking that she’s too hip or up-to-date with what I be doing, because I prefer her not to. I’m like, “This ain’t for you,” but she knows everything about me. She’s quick to tell me, “Boy, you’re my son. You think I don’t know this?” It’s just how it is. We’re best friends.

I ain’t never took it serious. I never introduced him to my music or asked him about signing me-- none of that. Everything just kind of happened for a reason. Earlier, my auntie that I was telling you about, that passed away -- she was married to Young Dolph’s uncle, and that’s how we’re cousins -- through marriage. Both of them are now passed away, so that’s another reason why our bond is stronger and tighter. It’s really deeper than rap. Blood is really thicker than water.

I was 18 going on 19. I was in the streets. I wasn’t too hip or had too much knowledge about the music industry like I do now. So back then, ain’t no telling, I probably would have been headfirst. I would have went with whatever, whoever-- as long as the bag right. Now, just by me being around Dolph and learning more about the business and how he orchestrates sh*t--’cause I’m right there, all the time, and I can see what’s going on-- I’ll say nah. Because it was my auntie who was the one who introduced him [Dolph] to my music. I was incarcerated. Soon as I graduated and my momma came home, I went in-- It’s a long story. Sh*t is all over the place. But when I was incarcerated, I had a song at the time called “Zeros” and It was buzzing through the city. I had dropped my first tape on my own, it was called </span><span>Whole Lot of Everything</span><span>. I ended up calling my auntie in jail-- calling just to check up on her-- and she was like, “Maymay wanna holla at you.” That’s Dolph’s nickname. Ain’t nobody know that though.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>So, she was like, “Maymay wanna holla at you, so and so, so and so.” I was like, “Auntie, I’m finna get out in a week or two anyway. I’ll holla at him then.” Because I always had a thing where I don’t like visitation, talking on the phone, because that sh*t makes me feel like I’m setting myself up to be there, knowing I’m finna roll. I ain’t finna be here. We ain’t gonna make this a thing, so don’t get comfortable with visiting and calling.

I’ll even give him a treatment for a video. I gave him two treatments before for a video. He’s gave me like five. That’s just how we work.

Nah, through my uncle. My uncle was living in Nashville at the time. His name’s Coop. He was doing a lot of parties and whatnot out there. He told me about Bandplay, like “You ever heard of Bandplay?” I’m like, “Bandplay? Who the f*ck is that?” He was playing his sh*t for me. I was like, “Where he from?” He’s like, “Bruh from Nashville.” “Nashville?!” He was like, “Yeah, he just produced a whole country album for so-and-so”-- I forgot who the dude was. I was like, “Oh, he’s versatile like that? Hit him up for me, tell him to send me some stuff.” Long story short, boom. We linked up, I did a couple songs like “Cocky.” He did most of </span><span>Glock Bond</span><span>, my second tape. He was all over that. Then I remember, about a month or two later, Dolph called me out the blue. He was like, “What’s up with Bandplay?” I was like, “Sh*t, what you mean what’s up with him?” He was like, “Man, that n*** hard.” I’m like, “Yeah, yeah he hard.” He was like, “Bruh, I need you to link me with him, so-and-so, so-and-so.” I was like, “Bruh, I’m just finna shoot you his number and let [him] know you finna call him.” Just like that, and boom, next you thing you know, gang gang.
