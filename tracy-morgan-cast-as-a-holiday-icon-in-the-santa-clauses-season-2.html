According to a recent <a href=#>Deadline</a> article, Tracy Morgan will be making a cameo appearance in Season 2 of The Santa Clauses as none other than The Easter Bunny.</p><p>Tracy Morgan’s role as The Easter Bunny in The Santa Clauses is such a far-left choice for the character that it’s perfect. Not only does he bring a certain raucous energy to the screen, but his ability to bounce off of other actors’ comedic timing should make him a great fit for the series.&nbsp;</p><p>Tracy Morgan’s casting in The Santa Clauses marks a reunion with show creator Jack Burditt with whom he worked on the NBC comedy series <a href=#>30 Rock</a>. Burditt is also known for his work on various <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=television data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>television</a> series like Frasier, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Modern Family, and The Mindy Project.</p><p>The Santa Clauses’ Tracy Morgan may best be known for his time as a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series<a href=#> Saturday Night Live</a> and his starring role alongside Tina Fey and <a href=#>Alec Baldwin</a> on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock. Morgan made his screen debut on the comedy series Martin before becoming a regular cast member on the sketch comedy show Uptown Comedy Club. He has appeared twice on HBO’s Def Comedy Jam and in the stand-up special, One Mic on Comedy Central, and as a cast member on series such as Crank Yankers, Where My Dogs At?, and The Tracy Morgan Show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/tim-allen-santa-clauses-900x507.jpg><p>Tracy Morgan had a life-shifting event happen in 2014 when he was involved in a near-fatal car crash that killed friend and fellow comedian James McNair while leaving Morgan severely injured. The actor has since had his own comedy special, Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive, where he addresses the incident and the requisite health issues that resulted from it. He has also since starred in the television series The Last O.G., much of which was based on his own experiences growing up in poverty.</p><p>The Santa Clauses is based on the Santa Clause film series, which includes the original The Santa Clause, its sequel The Santa Clause 2, and The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause. The franchise stars Tim Allen as Scott Calvin, an ordinary man who is given the title of Santa Clause and the requisite powers and responsibilities that come with it. In Season 2 of The Santa Clauses, Scott Calvin has returned to his role as Santa Claus while he trains his son in the family business.&nbsp;</p><p>Although it remains to be seen how Tracy Morgan’s character will be folded into The Santa Clauses’ second season, he is not the only new face that will appear on the screen. The second season also welcomes Gabriel Iglesias as Kris Kringle and Eric Stonestreet as Magnus Antas. They will appear alongside Elizabeth Mitchell as Mrs. Claus/Carol Calvin, Austin Kane as Cal Calvin-Claus, Elizabeth Allen-Dick as Sandra Calvin-Claus, Matilda Lawler as Betty, and Devin Bright as Noel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2isopawunnMqKmgmZ5isKK%2F02aqmqaklnqkuMCuqp6rXp3Brrg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vanessa-bryant-latest-news-pictures-videos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vanessa Bryant: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-shady-side-of-kim-zolciak-biermann.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Shady Side Of Kim Zolciak-Biermann</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
