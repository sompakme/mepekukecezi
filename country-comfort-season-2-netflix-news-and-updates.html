Instead, the show closed out with pretty much every loose end all tied up in a very heartwarming bow—but that won't stop fans from demanding even more episodes of the gentle musical-sitcom. Here's everything we know so far about season two of&nbsp;Country Comfort.</p><h2 id=has-xa0-country-comfort-xa0-been-renewed-for-a-second-season-3>Has&nbsp;Country Comfort&nbsp;been renewed for a second season?</h2><p>Not yet, but it's early days. Netflix typically waits a few weeks (or even months) to gauge audience reactions to each new series before announcing whether more episodes have officially received the green light. After its first weekend on the streaming platform,&nbsp;Country Comfort&nbsp;was hovering around the ninth slot on the Netflix top 10, which isn't exactly the same level of success experienced by recent hit shows like&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a35004828/bridgerton-season-2/>Bridgerton</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Queen's Gambit, but you never know—it might turn out to be a sleeper hit or, regardless of performance, Netflix might be determined to keep churning out episodes of the star-studded musical series.</p><h2 id=when-could-season-two-of-xa0-country-comfort-xa0-premiere-3>When could season two of&nbsp;Country Comfort&nbsp;premiere?</h2><p>If it does end up receiving the go-ahead, the show's second season could arrive fairly quickly. The first season was ordered in January 2020, then was able to premiere in March 2021, even with an industry-halting pandemic in between. Between that and Hollywood's cautious return to regular production schedules, new episodes of&nbsp;Country Comfort&nbsp;could easily hit the streamer about a year after the first season did, if not sooner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fSfJNLy5cqYnxqyJUY34dP-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=what-could-season-two-of-xa0-country-comfort-xa0-be-about-3>What could season two of&nbsp;Country Comfort&nbsp;be about?</h2><p>The biggest question at the end of the first season is whether Bailey (McPhee) won the singing competition that she signed up for, dropped out of, then ended up competing in with some last-minute help from her new family in the finale. If they did win, the next season of the show could see Bailey having a crisis over whether she should accept the competition's prize and go on tour to pursue her dreams of musical stardom, or stay home with the kids she's grown to love. Alternatively, if the judges were particularly impressed with Bailey and the kids' performance as a whole, we just might get to see them pack up and go on tour as a family band à la the Von Trapps.</p><p>Season two will also likely have to deal with the blooming love triangle between Bailey, her employer Beau (Eddie Cibrian), and his girlfriend Summer (Janet Varney), since Summer definitely seemed to be getting suspicious of Bailey and Beau's bonding over their shared love of Beau's kids—and whatever else their extremely heart-eyes-y shared look at the performance meant.</p><p>Beyond that, all we can really hope for from season two of&nbsp;Country Comfort&nbsp;are plenty more musically inspired episode names, lots of LeAnn Rimes cameos (which shouldn't be too hard, since she's literally married to the show's star), and absolutely no further mention of the storm cloud of broken promises and terrible decisions that is Bailey's ex-boyfriend Boone (Eric Balfour).</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
