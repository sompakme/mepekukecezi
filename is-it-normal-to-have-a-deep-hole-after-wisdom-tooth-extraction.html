Other possible causes are infection, certain foods, and stress.

They will only see a hole.<h2>Will dry socket heal itself?</h2>In most cases, dry socket will heal on its own, but as the site heals patients will likely continue to experience discomfort. If you do choose to treat dry socket at home, you need to clean the wound with cool water, irrigate the socket with saline, and keep gauze over the socket.<h2>How can you tell the difference between dry socket and normal pain?</h2>Dry sockets become increasingly painful in the days after a tooth extraction.
