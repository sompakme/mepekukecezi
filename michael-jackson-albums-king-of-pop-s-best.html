Michael Jackson was the most powerful man in show business at one point!&nbsp;Though he hasn’t been with us, his music is still relevant.&nbsp;Artists like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Usher</a>, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Chris Brown, and Ciara </a>idolized Jackson; his dance moves were his signature.&nbsp;Women used to faint when they saw him, and men admired his talent and successful reach in the industry. It was Michael Jackson’s world at one point, and we were all living in it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As time went on, Jackson kept reinventing himself. He went from singing innocent songs to disco-pop records that made you move your body.&nbsp;He then graduated to deliver a more meaningful message in his releases. Michael took the opportunity to discuss current events ranging from racism to world hunger.&nbsp; Still, the Indiana native continued to produce hits. Besides his music with The Jackson 5, Jackson has released ten solo albums.&nbsp;After Off the Wall dropped, he never looked back.&nbsp;Let’s go through <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Michael Jackson’s</a> best records.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">7. Got to Be There (1972)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You heard it with his brothers in The Jackson 5, but solo, you truly see how much of a star Michael is.&nbsp;Got to Be There was his debut solo album, to which the 13-year-old re-recorded classic songs. Jackson sang The Supremes’ “Love is Here and Now You’re Gone,” Arthur Ross’ “I Wanna Be Where You Are,” and Bill Withers’s “Ain’t No Sunshine."&nbsp;This was the beginning for Michael as he showcased his talents over the hit songs.&nbsp;Got to Be There gave Jackson his first gold plaque as well as his first placements on the charts.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">6. Invincible (2001)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Invincible is the last album we receive from Michael Jackson. It took him four years to make as he headed into the 2000s.&nbsp;Michael proved he could remain relevant with hit singles.&nbsp;”You Rock My World” and “Butterflies” were the most popular songs on this album.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">5. HIStory: Past, Present and <a href=# class=text-word>Future</a>, Book 1 (1995)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The first part of HIStory: Past, Present and Future Book 1 was a compilation of Michael’s hit songs. This included “Thriller,” “Beat It," “Man in the Mirror,” and “Rock With You,” along with a host of other hits.&nbsp;In the second part of the album, titled HIStory Continues, Jackson adds more hits to his repertoire.&nbsp;He partnered with<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> his sister, Janet Jackson</a>, for their hit song “Scream,” and also made songs with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>The Notorious B.I.G.</a> and Shaquille O’Neal.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">4. Dangerous (1991)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It seems like in every album, Jackson takes a new route.&nbsp;In Dangerous, he moves towards a more conscious approach when making records.&nbsp;A few of his most powerful songs are on this album, including “Black or White” and “<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Heal the World.</a>” His message was heard as his videos expressed the lyrics coming through the speakers.&nbsp;Jackson knew he had the power to try to bring the world together.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">3. Bad (1987)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Some will compare Bad to Thriller, but both albums are great and stand alone.&nbsp; Bad comes five years after Thriller and sounds similar, but you can just tell Michael had this music thing figured out.&nbsp;Once again, Quincy Jones and Jackson racked up hits as the singer wrote all but two songs.&nbsp;“Bad,” “The Way You Make Me Feel,” “Man in the Mirror,” “Dirty Diana,” “Smooth Criminal,” and “Leave Me Alone” are all gems of this album.&nbsp;Many would say this is also one of the best albums in music history.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">2. Off the Wall (1979)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The King of Pop broke out of his shell on Off the Wall.&nbsp; He wanted to show a different side of himself outside his kid star days.&nbsp;Off the Wall remains one of the biggest albums in music to date, as it is in the Grammy Hall of Fame. It took home the Grammy Award in 1980 for Best R&B Vocal Performance for a Male.&nbsp; “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough,” “Rock With You,” “Workin’ Day and Night,” and Off the Wall defined Jackson during this era.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-1-thriller-1982>1. Thriller (1982)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Over 40 years later, some will say Thriller is the best album ever. That’s across all genres!&nbsp;If you ever doubted Michael Jackson as the King of Pop, Thriller would make you believe. Produced by Quincy Jones, he and Michael had a bit of everything on the groundbreaking album. You heard rock, funk, disco, pop, and R&B throughout. “Thriller,” “Billie Jean,” “P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing),” and “The Girl Is Mine” were all signature songs.&nbsp;Seven tracks from Michael’s sixth studio album made the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Michael took home eight Grammy awards for the album, and the record was later included in the Grammy Hall of Fame. It is also included in the National Recording Registry.&nbsp;Today, Thriller remains one of the best-selling albums of all time.
