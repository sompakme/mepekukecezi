A youthful smile is typically wider and displays more of the upper teeth than the lower."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b4d360e107f7-julia-roberts-2.jpg><p id=e99E1YyQgs4R data-wc=53>As he says, a wide smile is considered the gold standard for a youthful grin â€“ think Julia Roberts and Margot Robbie, and you'll be along the right lines. Apparently, showing at least eight â€“ preferably ten â€“ upper teeth creates the most appealing and youthful smile, referred to as full buccal corridors.</p><p id=eQKtxVw5T7jk data-wc=38>As we age, our upper lip also gets longer, meaning less of our top teeth are on show which can make us look older, so by broadening&nbsp;the smile, the upper lip is supported, for a youthful look.</p><p id=e0HTE3Sxq8 data-wc=35>Dr. Alexandra Germain, cosmetic dentist and founder of <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Harley St. Identity Clinic</a> confirms that a youthful mouth is characterised by two millimetres of your two front teeth showing when your upper lip is at rest.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/871bd6f96692-team-dr-germain.jpg><p id=e8EsO4eD6hS data-wc=43>Explaining this, she says: "Imagine putting on lip gloss and pressing your lips together. When your upper lip comes back to its natural position at rest, note how many millimetres of your front teeth are showing. Two millimetres is the most youthful looking."</p><p id=eFUd5RI2B9 data-wc=15><strong>LOOK:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Celebrity teeth transformations: Dramatic before-and-after photos â€“ Kanye West, Demi Moore, Nicole Kidman, more</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>The solution: Tooth adjustments&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=eBTsjGACt3_D data-wc=52>"Adjusting the width of the buccal corridors (the space visible between the cheeks and teeth when smiling) can help balance the smile and contribute to a younger look," says Dr. Rhona, with composite bonding and Invisalign options for addressing this. Composite bonding is instant, while Invisalign is more of a long game.</p><p id=egbwt5Plkl28 data-wc=51>"Invisalign will address a narrow smile by moving crowded or crooked teeth outwards, allowing the smile to appear wider," confirms Dr. Sam. "Invisalign can also work to reshape your jawline, and if there is an overbite, Invisalign can close this, allowing the top teeth to sit comfortably on the bottom teeth.</p><p id=eOMfA9yDeSqk data-wc=22>"Realigning the teeth and changing the way they sit can enhance a personâ€™s facial features, such as the cheeks, lips and jaw."&nbsp;</p><p id=e-znhssPVt data-wc=45>Dr. Alexandra Germain agrees, noting: "From veneers to bonding through Invisalign there is a whole range of techniques when it comes to rejuvenating your smile and making you look younger, and in my experience, a smile makeover is more efficient than any filler or injectables."</p><p id=eFzEFMpUg6 data-wc=16><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>What has Kate Middleton done to her teeth? A top dentist reveals all- see transformation</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>The issue: Gum disease</strong></h2><p id=eJu_a-QxX2Vu data-wc=50>Pink gums that perfectly fit around the teeth are a key component of a youthful smile. However, the gums can recede which exposes the root of the tooth and causes the tooth to appear longer than it is, Dr. Sam explains. "Gum recession is most common in adults over 40.</p><p id=eqrT63wgMQXr data-wc=45>"Receding gums are often regarded as ageing. Gingival recession can be caused by periodontal disease which is a bacterial infection of the gum tissue, but more often it is caused by brushing teeth too hard, improper flossing, tobacco use, as well as abnormal tooth position."</p><p id=e61byBugVX data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Miley Cyrus smile makeover: what has she done to her teeth?

It's something that I prescribe a lot of to patients who&nbsp;wish to address receding gums and make teeth look younger.</p><p id=evmw0DvMXYvh data-wc=34>"I have noticed an increase in demand for gum tweakments," he says.

"These can be applied in a matter of minutes, theyâ€™re colour-matched perfectly to the rest of your teeth and not only help to make teeth look younger but also prevent the inside layers of teeth being exposed to bacteria and decay.</p><p id=eXSEe6_RoQB4 data-wc=33>"Veneers work to change the shape and structure of the teeth, which will significantly alter the appearance of the face, allowing it to appear less â€˜sunkenâ€™, which can happen with age," he continues.</p><p id=eFBE2o349J data-wc=13><strong>LOOK:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Taylor Swift's teeth transformation in before-and-after photos spark debate - see here</a></p><p id=euFGTI5C6VDr data-wc=56>Another option to create a smoother smile is composite bonding. Dr Sam explains: "Composite bonding is incredibly subtle and can enhance the shape of the tooth and create a neater smile. This technique is non-invasive and involves the application of a tooth-coloured composite resin to the surface of the tooth, which is then shaped and polished.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebb3B8QZQv8x data-wc=40>"This can correct chips, cracks, gaps and discolouration and protect exposed tooth roots.
