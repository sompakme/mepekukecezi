While the two bond over frozen yogurt, Matt doesn’t turn out to be the prince Mindy has been waiting for.

Unfortunately for Mindy, Jenner is not as willing to talk business with her as she had hoped. At least Mindy gets to tell Jenner that her “womb is a national treasure” before being escorted out of Jenner’s book signing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Stephen Colbert as Father Michael</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/stephen_colbert.jpg><p>The Late Show&nbsp;host guest stars as Father Michael in the season three episode “Confessions of a <span data-scayt_word=Catho-holic data-scaytid=1>Catho-holic</span>."

At Francis’ memorial, Danny is upset to learn that his former high school bully Michael is the new priest. Mindy, on the other hand, is upset to learn that the attractive priest can never get married. As Danny tries to escape the memorial service without being noticed, Michael puts his former classmate on the spot and declares to the churchgoers, “Word on the pew is that the golden boy of St. Mary’s and his girlfriend are living together before marriage.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Laverne Cox as Sheena</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/laverne_cox.jpg><p>The Orange is the New Black actress made her first appearance as the often-referenced but not-yet-seen cousin of Tamra (<span data-scayt_word=Xosha data-scaytid=1>Xosha</span> <span data-scayt_word=Roquemore data-scaytid=2>Roquemore</span>) in the season three episode “What to Expect When You’re Expanding.” When Mindy becomes self-conscious of how to dress as she becomes more visibly pregnant, Tamra arranges for aspiring stylist Sheena (Cox) to give Mindy a makeover. Sheena went on to make a few more appearances on the series, including in the season six episode “The Midwife’s Tale” when the <span data-scayt_word=Shulman data-scaytid=3>Shulman</span> & Associates office is abuzz about the identity of Tamra’s baby daddy.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Matt Sherman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mindyprojecttv_s4e1_02-h_2017.jpg><p>The 500 Days of Summer actor appeared in the season four opener as Matt Sherman, Mindy’s husband in an alternate universe that she finds herself in after learning that Danny is not at the friend’s wedding he was supposed to attend. Matt is an Emmy award-winning producer for Real Housewives and appears to be the perfect husband in a world that’s, well, perfect. But the longer Mindy lives in the alternate universe, the more she realizes that her life isn’t as great as she originally thought. For instance, her marriage is an open relationship, and Matt is a bit of a jerk. And she wakes up from the alternate-universe dream realizing that it is Danny who she belongs with.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>B.J.

However,&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Kaling’s data-scaytid=1>Kaling’s</span> former The Office co-star and real life best friend continues to make appearances throughout the series, most notably in the centennial episode in season five titled “Revenge of the Nurse.” &nbsp;The somewhat successful mystery writer invites Mindy and her co-workers to a book launch party, in which Mindy meets a Today show personality who is looking for a nurse to be in a segment. Mindy volunteers her then-boyfriend Ben (Bryan Greenberg) for the job, which begins the inevitable downward spiral of their relationship.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Ryan Hansen as Dr. Michael Lancaster</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ryan_hansen_mindy_on_the_mindy_project_-_publicity_-_h_split_2017.jpg><p>The season five episode “Mindy <span data-scayt_word=Lahiri data-scaytid=1>Lahiri</span> is a White Man” begins with Mindy not being taken seriously in a job interview because she's a female minority, although she is more than qualified for the position. Ryan Hansen stars as Dr. Michael Lancaster, a man that Mindy’s soul gets trapped in after she wishes she was a privileged white man. The majority of the episode follows Hansen’s hilarious portrayal as Mindy, and it turns out that being a handsome white man is just as easy as Mindy always thought it would be. While interviewing for the same position as Michael, it is revealed that a major reason Mindy wasn’t considered for the position was because of her gender and ethnicity. By the end of the episode, Mindy realizes that life as a white man is easier, but being unique is what keeps her life interesting.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Julie Bowen as Daisy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/julie_bowen.jpg><p>The Modern Family actress guest-stars in a season six episode as Daisy, a mother at the school Mindy’s son Leo attends. When Mindy learns that Leo has taken a liking to Daisy, she does everything she can to prove that she is as good of a mother as Daisy is to Daisy's unseen child. As Mindy attempts and fails to find the perfect balance between being a mother and doctor, she comes to accept that while she isn’t the most involved mother when it comes to her son’s education, she does the best she can. In fact, she takes pride in her effort to sing the entirety of Taylor Swift's&nbsp;Red album to Leo before his bedtime each night. Of course this revelation occurs after she gets into a physical altercation with Daisy.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Reese Witherspoon as Herself</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/reese_witherspoon.jpg><p>Given Mindy’s love of romantic comedies, it’s not surprising that <span data-scayt_word=Kaling’s data-scaytid=1>Kaling’s</span> friend and Wrinkle in Time co-star Reese Witherspoon would eventually make an appearance on the show. What is surprising, though, is that the Oscar-winning actress’ appearance puts Mindy’s unrealistic expectations that her life will play out like a movie to rest. When Mindy gets stuck in a cave after being abandoned by her tour group on vacation in the season six episode "Girl Gone Wild," she finds inner strength thanks to some advice from an imaginary Witherspoon. The actress tells Mindy that “movies aren’t real” and encourages her to actually read Wild by Cheryl Strayed, as opposed to walking around with a copy of the book because Witherspoon is on the cover.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-padding-r-1 a-font-accent-bold-xs lrv-u-color-black">Read More About:</h3><h2 id=section-heading class="c-heading larva a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase">THR Newsletters</h2><p class="c-tagline a-font-secondary-italic-s lrv-u-margin-a-00 lrv-u-margin-b-150@mobile-max">Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p><a class="c-button larva lrv-a-unstyle-button lrv-u-cursor-pointer lrv-u-padding-tb-075 lrv-u-padding-lr-150 lrv-u-border-color-brand-accent lrv-u-border-a-1 a-font-accent-bold-s lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-color-brand-accent u-margin-l-150@tablet" href=# rel><span class=c-button__inner>Subscribe</span> <span class=lrv-a-screen-reader-only>Sign Up</span></a><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title a-font-primary u-font-size-29 u-letter-spacing-000875 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase">Shopping With THR</h3><h2 id=section-heading class="c-heading larva a-font-primary-xs lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase">THR Newsletters</h2><p class="c-tagline a-font-accent-s lrv-u-text-align-center">Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>By providing your information, you agree to our <a href=# rel=nofollow>Terms of Use</a> and our <a href=# rel=nofollow>Privacy Policy</a>.We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. // This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=#>Terms of Service</a> apply.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uiqq2rX6K2r7DYZqerp5qasLV5xq6crKxdqMGivtJmaGltYmiDdXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./14-self-care-essentials-ashley-tisdale-swears-by.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>14 Self-Care Essentials Ashley Tisdale Swears By</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./you-re-doing-well-mr-macaroni-s-mummy-wa-and-motunde-share-stunning-new-photos-fans-gush.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Youre Doing Well: Mr Macaronis Mummy Wa and Motunde Share Stunning New Photos, Fans Gush</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
