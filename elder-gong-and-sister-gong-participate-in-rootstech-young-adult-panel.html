There is a remarkable convergence of the Spirit of Elijah, technology and our drawing closer to our Savior through temple ordinances,” he said. “Think of more temples coming to more people closer in more places than ever before. Think of drawing closer to God, our Father, and Jesus Christ through the ordinances and covenants in each temple. And think, third, millions of family names in all these different homelands are waiting for us so we can connect, belong and unite our families for eternity.”</p><p>The blessings are real, and they are for each of us as we come unto Jesus Christ and unite families for eternity, Elder Gong said.</p><p>“Through Jesus Christ and His Atonement, we and our families can be happy and forever, healed and at peace on both sides of the veil,” he said.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.thechurchnews.com/bs/images/icon-expand.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UFkTIr0QYg3NVaL_UiqajZI2XWY=/0x0:2200x1467/2200x1467/filters:focal(1100x734:1101x735)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24495912/20230303_231257_CBell_CMB_2279.jpg" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnJ%2BuqpOdu6bD0meaqKVfobKisMSrqmhqYGeAcH%2BOamtoamNrgHWAkWtmnqSUmr9us8SrqaKsXax6qLvNoGSsoaOpsrN5xqiloGWppMKvs4yam66kpGK9orrEpWSrp5%2BpwLWxwqFka2hiaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gop-pollster-frank-luntz-reveals-replicas-of-the-oval-office-monica-lewinsky-s-blue-dress-in-his.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>GOP Pollster Frank Luntz Reveals Replicas of the Oval Office, Monica Lewinskys Blue Dress in His</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cillian-murphy-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cillian Murphy Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
