He has two children and often makes them a focal point of his music and albums. That also extends to his wife Nicole Tuck. She celebrated her birthday earlier this week and Khaled had the perfect post ready. In the post, he shared a number of stunning photos of the pair and their two children together over the years.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Khaled also paid tribute to his wife in an adorable caption.

Just <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">last month was Khaled's birthday</a> and plenty of artists he's worked with in the past emerged to wish him happy birthday. Rappers like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Raekwon</a> showed the DJ and producer love for his big day. Even that came just a month after his son celebrated his 7th birthday in October.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Last month, DJ Khaled appeared on Shannon Sharpe's podcast where he made some claims that fans found suspicious. He claimed to have <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">known Birdman and Lil Wayne before either of them were famous</a>. While that may help explain how he got some of his A-list connections, many fans didn't believe his story. Many pointed out the Wayne and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Birdman</a> themselves have claimed to know each other since long before Khaled says in his story.
