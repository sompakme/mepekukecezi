That is certainly going on now, as a video on Twitter has emerged showing off some of the costumes from Thor: Love and Thunder. While that might not sound like the time in which easter eggs can be found, there are some background images that fans have begun to dive deeper into. One such character seems to be Konshu, as we see his iconic moon staff shown. However, fans have also pointed out that we see what appears to be <a href=#>Namor</a>. He is said to be of Aztec origin in this new MCU continuity, and there seems to be a shot of a blue-skinned person with a unique headdress on. You can see the <a href=#>video </a>below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Before even hitting start on the <a href=#>video </a>to get a closer look at the costumes in Thor: Love and Thunder, you can see the moon staff to the direct right of the video still, with what might be either Khonshu or Moon Knight. Directly in the middle of Valkyrie and Thor’s costumes sits what appears to be Namor. He is standing on what appears to be a podium with a magnificent headdress on. Also, his iconic blue skin is showing as well, leaving fans to presume that he will be introduced in this new MCU entry. Fans have been clamoring for a chance to see Namor appear, and this simple video showing off costumes might have solidified that want.</p><p>There have been rumors that Namor was supposed to be introduced in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, but he could be making a cameo in Thor: Love and Thunder. There have been small hints that have appeared on the set of <a href=#>Black Panther 2</a> though, such as a crew hat featuring Aztec Jaguar God, Tepeyollotl. The Atlanteans in the comics all bare blue skin, which is the same for Attuma. Should he be appearing, then it is safe to assume that we are going to be seeing Namor make his MCU debut as well, considering Attuma is the enemy of Namor. Then again, Gorr the God Butcher is a god killer, so maybe he is set to attempt to take down some Atlantean gods, which leads to Namor siding with Thor and his gang. Just a thought.</p><p>Thor: Love and Thunder is set to release on July 8th, and we are all impatiently waiting to see how this new MCU entry plays out. There needs to be a bit of a shake-up in Marvel’s continuity now that the Avengers are all but gone. The multiverse has been opened wide as well, but we need to see where the next phase takes the core story. It would be great to see who the next big baddie is going to be. There has been plenty of rumors in terms of Kang the Conquerer and Dr. Doom. Kang has already been introduced in Loki, though it was a variant of the villain. Kang is set to debut in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Namor could even be the big baddie as he was viewed as an anti-hero in the comics. We will all have to wait until July to truly find out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ismKS%2FbrjOr5xmmZ6ZerW01Kebnqpdnru1vs6drJyhnpx6r63MqKlnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./time-will-destroy-you-lyrics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Time will destroy you lyrics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./russ-millions-net-worth-2024-updated-wealth-of-the-rapper.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Russ Millions Net Worth 2024: Updated Wealth Of The Rapper</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
