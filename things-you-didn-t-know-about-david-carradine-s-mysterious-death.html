"I believe he was <a href=#>murdered</a>," she said, adding, "That's all there is to it."&nbsp;In her memoir, David Carradine: The Eye of My Tornado, she asserts that the details around his passing, including what was apparently found during his <a href=#>autopsy</a>, "just don't fit."</p><p>Anderson acknowledges that Carradine did engage in kinky sex practices during the time that they were married from 1998 to 2001, including "a penchant for bondage and being choked to the point of orgasm," per ABC News. However, she noted why the report concerning his death doesn't make sense, explaining, "For David to accidentally do it to himself, that's not the act. He never flew solo when we were together. That didn't fit the scenario. David liked participation."&nbsp;</p><p>She continued by noting that "you can't have marks around your neck by just doing an autoerotic or sexual asphyxiation," saying that "it went over the line. There was something really hinky that happened." Anderson also has a theory as to what that "hinky"&nbsp;occurrence may have been.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2ppbYB4e9OhoKefo2LGsMGMnaCdpqRiuK%2B71maYm6elqXqlrdWim2abkae%2ForDIp5ysZZ2uwLWx0aKmrqtdmbKiwMdo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-osteostrong-cost.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What does OsteoStrong cost?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-true-story-behind-american-nightmare-and-denise-huskins-kidnapping.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The True Story Behind 'American Nightmare' and Denise Huskins' Kidnapping</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
