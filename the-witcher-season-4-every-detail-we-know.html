Following the series premiere in 2019 (which still has the highest viewership numbers of the show's run), season 2 returned in 2021, and season 3 didn't arrive til 2023.

Among the actors expected to appear include Anya Chalotra (Yennefer), Freya Allan (Ciri), Joey Batey (Jaskier), Milva (Meng’er Zhang), Anna Shaffer (Triss), Graham McTavish (Dijkstra), Cassie Clare (Phillipa), Hugh Skinner (Radovid), Eamon Farren (Cahir), Mimî M.

After the country's soldiers invaded Aretuza and decimated the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, with the help of their secret ally Vilgefortz, Nilfgaard continued to push forward into the North. Among the forces working to defeat Emperor Emhyr include the kingdom of Redania, led by new king Radovid, spymaster Dijkstra, and mage Phillipa; Yennefer and the remaining Aretuza mages; and Geralt, who's traveling with Jaskier. Several of Emhyr's allies are set to turn on him too: soldier Cahir has pledged his life to Ciri, elven queen Francesca just found out that Emhyr killed her newborn child, and Fringilla will likely turn on Nilfgaard at the first chance she gets.</p><p>Meanwhile, after her time in the Korath desert, Ciri is rescued by a young gang of outlaws known as the Rats. She introduces herself to them as Falka, adopting the moniker of the ancient part-elf princess who appeared to Ciri in the desert and goaded her into using fire magic, before Ciri relinquished her powers. In her life, Falka (an ancestor of Ciri's) led a rebellion against her own family before being burned at the stake. In addition to Ciri's new name signaling that she has become much more ruthless over the years (as well as her first human kill), it also foreshadows the impending face-off between Ciri and Emhyr, who we know is her father Duny. Speaking of Emhyr, he doesn't know yet that the "Princess Cirilla" who Vilgefortz brought him is fake, so him ultimately finding out is another plot thread to watch out for. Even Geralt doesn't know that Emhyr's "Ciri" is fake, which is why he's on the warpath straight to Nilfgaard.</p><p>As for book spoilers, Netflix has confirmed that seasons 4 and 5 will cover the Witcher novels <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://bookshop.org/p/books/baptism-of-fire-andrzej-sapkowski/18424467 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1535322&u=1338591&m=97137&afftrack=hawk-custom-tracking&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fbaptism-of-fire-andrzej-sapkowski%2F18424467" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=bookshop.org data-merchant-id=281657 data-merchant-url=bookshop.org data-merchant-network=Generic>Baptism of Fire</a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-tower-of-swallows-andrzej-sapkowski/18424470 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1535322&u=1338591&m=97137&afftrack=hawk-custom-tracking&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fthe-tower-of-swallows-andrzej-sapkowski%2F18424470" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=bookshop.org data-merchant-id=281657 data-merchant-url=bookshop.org data-merchant-network=Generic>The Tower of the Swallow</a>, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Lady-Lake-Witcher-Andrzej-Sapkowski/dp/031627383X referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FLady-Lake-Witcher-Andrzej-Sapkowski%2Fdp%2F031627383X%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon>Lady of the Lake</a>, following season 3's plot based on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-time-of-contempt-andrzej-sapkowski/15285636 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1535322&u=1338591&m=97137&afftrack=hawk-custom-tracking&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fthe-time-of-contempt-andrzej-sapkowski%2F15285636" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=bookshop.org data-merchant-id=281657 data-merchant-url=bookshop.org data-merchant-network=Generic>A Time of Contempt</a>.
