In 2009, more than a hundred years later, a similar amusement park opened in Kunming, the capital city of Yunnan Province in southern China.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop><p>No special skills are necessary for performers at Kingdom of the Little People—no acrobatic training or dancing experience is needed.</p><p>“There are only three requirements to work here,” creator Cheng Mingjing <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>told</a> ABC’s Nightline soon after its opening. “No infectious diseases, no one older than 50, and no one taller than 4 feet 3.”</p><p>At Kingdom of the Little People, a cast of entertainers and staffers exclusively shorter than 51 centimeters dance and sing in exotic outfits for twice-daily shows. They play Arabian dancers and knights, kings and fairies; musicians serenade the audience and circus acrobats wow with stunts like tightrope walking and eyelid weight lifting; men in tutus dance to “Swan Lake,” and a “Dwarf King” rules over his mini-empire.</p><p>This community of 100-odd Chinese little people ranging in age from 19 to 49 live together in dorms with specially designed amenities for their small statures, sharing meals in a communal dining hall. Visitors to the park can watch their performances on a terraced stage and tour the whimsical, mushroom-like structures of the “kingdom” where they work and pretend to live.</p><p>The park was a $14 million project built by average-sized Chinese entrepreneur and real-estate businessman Chen Mingjing in 2009. “I hope this 'kingdom' can help them live better lives. They can spend the rest of their lives here if they like,” he told <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>China Daily</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Five years after its launch, the theme park unsurprisingly has collected fire from all sides. Human rights groups like Handicap International and Little People of America have attacked its exploitative nature, an accusation shared by prominent, short-statured actor Warwick Davis. “What’s happening in China is segregation, it’s exploitation,” Davis said on <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>an episode</a> of <i>An Idiot Abroad</i>. It’s difficult not to liken it to the shameful displays of so-called freak shows that toured Europe and America in circuses, <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>human zoos</a>, and Ripley’s “Believe It or Not” exhibits in the early 20th century.</p><p>“What is the difference between it and a zoo?” a spokesman for Little People of America asked The New York Times.</p><p>But the Kingdom of the Little People’s creator and its residents have convincingly argued that the park provides the only opportunity for acceptance and economic prosperity available in China. The workers are treated respectfully and are able to earn a self-reliant living. They make a monthly salary of between 1,000 and 3,000 Yuan, or $160 to $480, along with free room and board. Performers speak of an equality and acceptance in the park that isn’t practiced in the outside community.</p><p>“I never realized that there were so many people like me until I came here,” one young dancer told a <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Vice crew</a> who went to the park this year to report on the daily life of its performers.</p><p>“When we used to go out in the world, we’d be made fun of,” a 23-year-old performer said. “[T]hat would really hurt our confidence.”</p><p>With social and economic necessity trumping political correctness, the Kingdom of the Little People paints a broader picture of China’s treatment of its disabled population—a group <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>some</a> in the dwarf community identify as part of—and the discouraging prospects they face. In 2013, Human Rights Watch issued a <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>report</a> saying that nearly 40 percent of the estimated 83 million disabled Chinese are illiterate due to schools’ rampant discrimination against disabled children.</p><p>Today, little people continue to be used for entertainment in ways that draw condemnation around the world. In Mexico, crowds gather to watch <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>dwarf bullfighters</a> taunt their calves with red capes for pay of $50 to $100. In the U.S., dwarf tossing has been <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>condemned</a> as a cruel excuse for a sport.</p><p>But participants in these activities often defend themselves and the spectacle they provide. “If a little person can fight a bull, he can do anything,” one bullfighting dwarf <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>said</a> of his chosen profession. “That’s what we’re trying to prove.”</p><p>In China, Chen hopes to expand his mini-kingdom as popularity grows, shooting for a staff of 1,000 dwarfs. Six months after the grand opening, the managers were already receiving three or four job requests from little people seeking employment. “Under the current social situation in China, they really will not be able to find a better employment situation,” Chen’s assistant <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>told The New York Times.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmV%2BdXuPb2ZpbV%2BYtaq6wGafmqtdlnqlw8CrnWaZnarAprnEp6tmqJGnuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./clinical-research.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Clinical Research</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./can-you-cut-off-a-taste-bud.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Can you cut off a taste bud?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-the-recent-baby-formulas-recalls-what-to-do-if-you-have-any.html>All the Recent Baby Formulas Recalls &amp;amp; What To Do if You Have Any</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./amanda-seales-checks-shannon-sharpe-for-downplaying-her-racist-bullying-experience.html>Amanda Seales Checks Shannon Sharpe For Downplaying Her Racist Bullying Experience</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./atlanta-rapper-lil-bike-shows-off-his-lifestyle-on-professional.html>Atlanta Rapper Lil Bike Shows Off His Lifestyle On &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot;</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bauchi-bye-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-in-dass-constituency.html>Bauchi bye-election: INEC declares APC winner in Dass constituency</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eden-hazard-net-worth-2023-what-is-the-soccer-legend-worth.html>Eden Hazard Net Worth 2023: What Is The Soccer Legend Worth?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzDash.
