While he's been hitting tour stops on his series of It's All A Blur shows, he's also found himself beefing with numerous frequent collaborators. It started when <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a> & Metro Boomin dropped their highly-anticipated collaborative album WE DON'T TRUST YOU last week. The album featured the song "Like That" where Kendrick Lamar used his guest verse to take shots at both Drake and J. Cole.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The song became the most talked about rap moment of the year so far and the more people weighed in the more beefs it seemed to spark. One of the biggest was with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a>. Video showed Scott backstage during Future and Metro Boomin's Rolling Loud set encouraging them to play the Drake diss. Drizzy reacted by <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">pretending to shoot at a prop of Scott's head</a> during a performance of their collaboration "Meltdown." That came in addition to beef with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rick Ross</a> that resulted in the two rappers unfollowing each other on Instagram. Now Drizzy is seemingly addressing all of it in his new Instagram post. Check out what he shared with his fans below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-s-newest-instagram-post>Drake's Newest Instagram Post</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Red herself clapped back pretty quickly. Her first response was a simple one when she went on Twitter to call Budden "dumb" for the comments. A few days later she hit back again sharing an NSFW video of her twerking on Drake while the pair are on stage performing together as evidence of why he might enjoy being around her. What do you think of Drake's newest Instagram post? Who do you think he intended for the post to be aimed at?
